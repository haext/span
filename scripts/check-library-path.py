"""Hold every `span-panel-api` path in `pyproject.toml` to the library checkout.

`pyproject.toml` is a committed, shared file, and two blocks in it decide where
`span_panel_api` comes from: `[tool.uv.sources]`, which every import in the suite
resolves through, and `[tool.pyright].extraPaths`, which decides what the type
checker reads. Both are written as relative paths so they mean the same thing in
the primary checkout and in every worktree beside it.

Working against unreleased library code needs those paths aimed somewhere else
for a while, and the obvious way to do that is to edit them. That is what
happened in `3cbf02a`: both blocks were pointed at a scratch worktree and
committed. It stood for several commits and a few hours of other people's work,
and while it stood the conformance tests ran against a producer defect the
library had already fixed. Every version-based check passed -- the stale worktree
declared the same version number as the corrected code. A version string does
not identify content; only a filesystem location does.

So the redirection does not belong in a committed file at all. It belongs in the
virtual environment, where it affects one developer's next command and nothing
else, and `developer.md` ("Working against unreleased library code") says how.
This hook is what makes that the only route: it rejects a `pyproject.toml` whose
`span-panel-api` paths name anything but the checkout.

Absence is not a failure. CI deletes the whole `[tool.uv.sources]` block before
installing, so it resolves from PyPI and re-runs these hooks against a file that
no longer has one. A block that is not there declares nothing to be wrong about.

Relative rather than absolute because an absolute path would be correct on

primary checkout and from a worktree placed beside it, and misses from a worktree
nested inside the checkout, as `.claude/worktrees/<name>` is. `setup-hooks.sh`
closes that gap with a symlink rather than this file with a second spelling,
