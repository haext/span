"""Build real adapter field metadata from the adapters' own reference payloads.

The library's own harness compares wire-level deltas between schemas; it cannot
know what this integration declares it reads. These helpers give the
integration's tests real adapter output to check declarations against.

The payloads are package data of the two adapter distributions, read through
`importlib.resources` exactly as the library's own suite reads them, so the bytes
replayed here are the bytes shipped by the wheel `manifest.json` pins. The pin is
the provenance: bumping it is what moves the capture, and nothing has to keep a
copy of it honest.

Uses the real `ebus_sdk.DiscoveredDevice` rather than a stand-in. A
description-only stand-in is not sufficient: `_downstream_lugs_metadata` ->
`find_lugs` reads property *values* via `device.get_property(...)`, so a stand-in
either raises or silently loses the five downstream/feedthrough paths. ebus-sdk
arrives transitively with span-panel-api-schema-1, so the import is free.
