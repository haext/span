"""Every enum sensor must declare the states it can actually report.

Home Assistant renders `options` as the entity's "Possible states" and validates the
state against it. Eight sensors declared `["unknown"]` and nothing else, so a panel
reporting `dsm_on_grid` showed a live state that its own entity said was impossible.

`sensor_base` tried to fix this at runtime, appending each value as it was first
observed. That does not work, and could not: options would only ever list states the
panel had already reached, so `dsm_off_grid` stays absent until the day of an actual
outage, and the advertised set differs between two identical panels depending on what
each has lived through. A value domain that is known when the code is written should
be declared there.

The translations are the authority rather than a second hand-maintained list: a state
with no translation renders to a user as a raw key like `dsm_on_grid`, and an option
with no state to match is dead weight. Both are the same defect seen from either end,
so one list is derived from the other.
