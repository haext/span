"""Tests for the control gate: who may operate the panel, and the record of it.

These exercise the interceptor directly rather than going through the platforms.
Every existing control test assigns a mock client to `coordinator.client`, and a
mock has no interceptor — so a platform test proves nothing about the gate, and
assuming otherwise would leave the gate untested while looking covered.
