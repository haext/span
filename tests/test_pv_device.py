"""The solar inverter gets a device of its own, and takes its entities with it.

PV was the last DER on a v1.0 panel with no card. Its vendor, model and
nameplate capacity were rendered as three diagnostic sensors on the *panel's*
device — beside the panel's own manufacturer and model, so a panel card read as
if the enclosure were an Enphase inverter — and the firmware version the library
has always read reached nothing at all, because a version has nowhere to go but
a card. `pv/info/firmware-version` was baselined naming exactly that.

**The identifier is the decision worth writing down.** `{panel serial}_pv`, and
deliberately not the inverter's serial. Every PV `$description` declares
`info/serial-number` and no producer publishes one, so an identifier that
preferred a serial would be `<panel>_pv` on every panel today and
`<panel>_<serial>` on the first panel whose firmware starts publishing one — and
a device identifier is what a consumer keys its registry on, so that day would
read as the inverter being replaced. `test_a_serial_arriving_on_the_wire_does_not_move_the_device`
produces that day and asserts nothing moves.

**The migration is the risk.** Existing installations have these entities on the
panel device with panel-scoped `unique_id`s and panel-scoped `entity_id`s. Moving
an entity to another device must change *only* the device: a changed `entity_id`
breaks a dashboard, a changed `unique_id` orphans the entity and mints a
duplicate. Home Assistant re-homes an entity by itself when it re-registers with
new `device_info` — `async_get_or_create` returns the entry it already holds for
a `unique_id`, updates its `device_id` and leaves its `entity_id` untouched — so
there is no bespoke migration here and deliberately none written.

**The fork in entity ids is deliberate; do not close it.** Nothing pins an
`entity_id`. Home Assistant derives a new entity's object id from the name of the
device it belongs to, so a fresh installation gets
`sensor.span_panel_solar_pv_vendor` where every existing one keeps
`sensor.span_panel_pv_vendor`. Both are correct: an existing installation must
never have an id change under it, and a new one gets the standard Home Assistant
assignment rather than a legacy shape invented to match history it does not have.
An earlier revision pinned the panel-scoped id on both to keep the two identical;
that was reversed, because the pin bought uniformity by giving every future
installation an entity id derived from the wrong device.
`test_a_fresh_install_and_a_migrated_one_differ_only_in_entity_id` is the record
of the decision.

Every expectation about what the card shows is read out of the reference capture
and proved by republishing or unpublishing the property, never by a literal. The
registry-shape expectations *are* literals, on purpose: they record what a
released installation carries, and deriving them from the code under test would
make the migration assertions vacuous.

    **This asymmetry is a decision, not a bug.** An earlier revision pinned the
    panel-scoped `entity_id` on both installations so they matched exactly. That
    was reversed. The governing constraint is that an *existing* installation's
    `entity_id` and `unique_id` must never change — dashboards, automations and
    history all name them — and that constraint is satisfied by Home Assistant's
    own behaviour, without a pin: `async_get_or_create` honours a suggested
    object id only at first registration. The pin therefore did nothing for the
    installed base; all it did was give every *future* installation an entity id
    derived from the panel rather than from the device the entity actually sits
    on, permanently, to match a history that installation does not have.

    So: same `unique_id`s, same device, different `entity_id`s, decided by install
    date. If you are reading this because the divergence looks wrong, it is
    intended — the fix is not to pin the legacy shape back on.

    Compared over `{entity_id: (unique_id, device identifiers)}` — every fact a
    user or a dashboard can name — so an entity filed under the wrong card fails
    with its entity_id in the message.
