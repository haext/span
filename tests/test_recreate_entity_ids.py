"""Recreate entity IDs proposes the ID the current panel data would produce.

Issue #252: renaming a circuit in the SPAN app left "Recreate entity IDs" (the
HA registry's `async_regenerate_entity_id`) proposing the entity's own ID, so
the button appeared to do nothing.

The registry generates an ID from three fields in priority order: the user's
`name` override, then `suggested_object_id`, then `object_id_base`. In
friendly-names mode this integration never writes a registry `name` -- the
panel name reaches the UI through `original_name` -- so `name` is None, the
generator short-circuits to `suggested_object_id`, and that field is whatever
was suggested when the entity was first added. It was frozen because the
integration preset the entity's *stored* ID on every reload, suggesting the
value already in place.

Every case here reloads before asserting. Asserting straight after creation
tests the first-add path, where the suggestion is trivially current and the bug
cannot appear.

# --- Phase 2: a rename in the SPAN app still reaches the display name ---------
#
# The README promises it in both modes (:594, :602): friendly names
# "automatically updates when you rename circuits in the SPAN panel", and
# circuit-numbers mode keeps ids stable while "friendly names still sync from
# SPAN panel for display". One mechanism serves both. A coordinator push
# carrying a changed circuit name asks the entry to reload, and the reload is
# what rebuilds `_attr_name` -- which Home Assistant stores as `original_name`.
# The shortcut the old scheme took, writing the registry's `name` in place, is
# exactly what made Recreate propose a friendly-name id for a circuit-numbered
# entity, so the mechanism has to keep costing a reload.
#
# The per-platform unit tests drive this against a `MagicMock` registry, which
# cannot see where the name landed. These drive it through a real
# `EntityPlatform` and the real registry, for all three circuit platforms in
# both modes, because handing composition the id moved where the name is
# written.
