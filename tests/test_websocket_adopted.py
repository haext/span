"""The adopted commands: list reports every curatable row, curate stores one.

Three things carry the list surface and each fails loudly here if it stops
holding: a row's key is the one the curate command will be handed back, the
allowed choices are computed from the wire rather than offered blind, and a
stored record that no longer fits its declaration is *shown* rather than silently
sanitised -- the editor is where a user finds out their assertion went stale.

Curate is tested against the same fixtures for the reason that matters most about
it: the keys it accepts and the choices it admits are the ones list offered, and
a second derivation of either would let the editor save something the entities
never read. Its refusals are asserted by code, its side effects are asserted to
be exactly three -- the store, the reload, the reply -- and the registry is
asserted to be untouched.
