"""Identity that reaches a device card, an attribute or a diagnostic sensor.

Four surfaces, one new entity class, and one of them is a regression rather
than a feature. Grouped because they share a proof obligation: each is a value
the panel has published all along that nothing rendered, so a test asserting a
constant the code also holds would pass whether or not the wire is ever read.

Every expectation below is therefore read out of the reference capture, and every
reading is proved by republishing it, unpublishing it, or both. The device-card
assertions go through the real device registry after a real registration rather
than through the `DeviceInfo` dict, because the dict is what the code returns and
the registry is what a user sees.

**`panel.wifi_ssid` is the regression.** Flat published `core/wifi-ssid` and the
integration has surfaced it as an attribute since; v1.0 declares
`status/wifi-ssid`, schema_1 mapped nothing to it, and the path's exemption
annotation said `SCHEMA_0_ONLY` -- which was true, and sanctioned a user losing
an attribute on upgrade. With the library reading it, both adapters produce the
path, so it is a declaration now and the producible gate covers it.

It is published on the **Wi-Fi Link binary sensor**, which is the coherent host:
the entity that reports whether Wi-Fi is up is the one that should say which
network it is up on, and both values come off the same node on the wire. The
Software Version sensor no longer carries it. That narrowing had already begun
undocumented -- at v2.0.8 four `STATUS_SENSORS` descriptions rendered the
attribute and three have since moved elsewhere, leaving one -- and this finishes
it and writes it down.
