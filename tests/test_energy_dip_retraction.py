"""A counter reset is permanent, so a dip the next reading disproves is retracted.

Dip compensation books an offset the moment a counter reads lower than it did,
and that write is irreversible: it lands in Home Assistant's long-term
statistics. The evidence for it is one sample. `SpanPanel/span#259` is what that
costs when the sample is wrong — a transient zero booked the whole lifetime
counter as an offset on every restart, reaching megawatt-hours.

The library no longer fabricates that particular zero (an unreported reading is
`None`, which skips compensation entirely). This is the layer under it: whatever
the source, a reading that drops and then comes back was never a reset, because
a reset is permanent. So the offset is provisional until a later reading either
disproves it — the counter returns to where it was — or corroborates it, by
counting up from the lower base.

**Corroboration needs independent progress, not merely a second low reading.**
Confirming on any reading below the baseline would confirm on a second copy of
the same bad sample, which is exactly the shape a replay produces: snapshots are
dispatched on a debounce, so one burst can deliver the same incomplete state
twice. That is the failure this rule exists to catch, so it must not be the
failure that satisfies it.

**And corroboration is evidence rather than proof.** The same burst that
replays one stale sample can replay two, the second slightly higher than the
first, which is indistinguishable on the tick from a counter climbing away from
a fresh base. So corroborating does not close the record: for
`CONFIRMED_RETRACTION_WINDOW` more readings a return to the baseline still
retracts it. The reading that closes the window *settles* the dip — the offset
is final and the user is told — because a compensation that could be undone at
any future reading would be undone by the ordinary growth of a counter that
really did reset.

**A dip inside that window is a dip of its own**, kept apart from the older one
and judged against the reading it fell from. A 3 Wh artefact folded into a
1000 Wh dip's record would be measured against a baseline the counter cannot
reach again inside the window, so it could never be retracted — a small replay
made permanent by a large one.

The cost is that a genuine reset on a circuit drawing nothing stays unconfirmed
until it next moves. Compensation is applied throughout — only the notification
waits — so the sensor reads correctly while the evidence is outstanding.
