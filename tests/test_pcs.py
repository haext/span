"""The Power Control System, surfaced as three entities and fifteen attributes.

Thirteen of the attributes are on the effective-limit sensor and two are on
every circuit's power sensor.

`energy.ebus.capability.pcs` 0.3 is the largest capability the enclosure
publishes — sixteen properties on the panel, two on every circuit — and nothing
read a byte of it. The capability itself says what to surface: it reconciles
every active import constraint to one enforced current limit, and "what `pcs`
publishes is the **result**: the effective `import-limit` and the
`binding-constraint`". So the result is the entities, and the arbitration behind
it is their attributes.

**The capture is a PCS that is switched off, and every test here is written
around that.** Every limit is `0.0`, every enablement `UNCONFIGURED`, every
boolean `false`. Uniform data makes an assertion cheap to satisfy for the wrong
reason — an entity wired to the neighbouring property reports the identical
value, and an entity hardcoding a zero agrees with the wire by accident. So no
state or attribute here is asserted against the captured values. Presence is
checked against the capture; every *reading* is proved by republishing a value
that differs from the captured one and from every sibling's, and the sensor's
whole attribute dictionary is compared at once, so a wrong wiring shows up as a
value under the wrong name rather than as a value that happens to match.

    about the *device* — "a configuration parameter or diagnostics of a device" —

    about the user's supply too, and both are diagnostic.

    The line this codebase actually draws is not "amps are diagnostic":
    `circuit_current` and `evse_advertised_current` are amps and are correctly
    primary, because they are what a circuit or a charger is doing right now. It
    is that the panel's own voltages, lug currents, breaker ratings and limits
    describe the installation rather than its activity. Import Limit is one of
    those, and was the only entity outside the rule — and the only member of its
    own PCS group on the primary card.

    It is a ceiling the panel arbitrated rather than a measurement of what is
    flowing, and it carries the four limits it was arbitrated from as attributes.
    Changed while the entity was days old and had appeared in exactly one
    release's addition notice, so no installation has a dashboard or history
    depending on where it sits.
