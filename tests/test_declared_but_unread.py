"""Every property the panel declares must reach a user, or say why it does not.

The consumer-side mirror of panelbench's `test_declared_but_unvalued`, which
asks the producer whether it ever publishes what it declares. This asks whether
anything ever reads what arrives.

**Why this and not the producible gate.** `test_field_path_conformance` starts
from what the integration declares it reads and checks an adapter produces it.
That direction cannot see a property nobody reads: an unread declaration is
absent from every list the gate consults, so it is invisible by construction.
`panel.wifi_ssid` is the worked example — flat surfaces it, v1.0 declares it,
schema_1 maps nothing to it, and its `RESIDUAL_EXEMPT_PATHS` annotation said
`SCHEMA_0_ONLY`, which was *true* and still sanctioned a silent regression.
Every check in the codebase agreed, and a user upgrading lost an attribute.

**How consumption is decided, and why not from a list.** A hand-kept map of
"properties we read" is what made a new property invisible in the first place,
so this derives the answer by experiment instead: republish one declared
property with a different value, rebuild the snapshot through the real schema_1
mapper, and see which snapshot fields moved. A property that moves a field the
integration reads is surfaced; one that moves nothing reaches nobody. Nothing
here restates `_PROPERTY_FIELD_MAP`, the lugs direction tables, the topology
readers or the device_info builders — the experiment sees all of them, and sees
them the way a user does, through what the panel actually renders.

That is deliberately stricter than "mapped by `_PROPERTY_FIELD_MAP`". A property
the library reads into a snapshot field no entity, attribute or device card ever
touches has not reached anybody: `circuit.is_240v`, `evse.part_number` and
`pv.software_version` are each one library line and no user-visible effect. They
are baselined here rather than counted as read.

**The two enumerations, and why neither can absorb a new property.**
`_INTERNAL_ROUTES` holds what the snapshot cannot express — adapter dispatch, a
shadowed fallback tier, a topology branch no producer reaches. The baseline file
holds what is genuinely unread, one reason per line. Both are compared as exact
sets, so an entry that stops being true fails just as loudly as a declaration
that arrives untriaged. A new property can only ever land in either by somebody
writing the line.
