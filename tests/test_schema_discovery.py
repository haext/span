"""What the panel declares that nothing here reads, surfaced to a maintainer.

`test_declared_but_unread` asks this question of the reference capture and
answers it by experiment. It is the right check and it is fixture-bound: a real
panel that starts publishing a property fails nothing until somebody recaptures.
The adapter answers the same question at runtime, for the panel in front of the
user, and this module is the consumer half — the partition that keeps those rows
out of every curated inventory, and the diagnostics block that carries them to
whoever is triaging the issue.

Two properties are load-bearing and both are asserted here rather than reviewed:

**The partition.** Discovered rows arrive in the same map as curated ones. Every
inventory downstream — the producible gate, the unread set, the exemption
annotations, the unit vocabulary — reads "in an adapter's map" as "this
integration could read this", which a discovered path is not. One namespace test
applied once is what keeps that true, and `test_the_unread_inventory_is_deaf_to
_discovery` is the mutation proof that it is applied.

**No value leaves.** A diagnostics payload goes into GitHub issues and forum
posts. `TO_REDACT` is key-based over the config entry and knows nothing about
wire property names, so nothing downstream can protect a value put in this
block. It carries declarations only, and that is checked against the capture's
own published values.
