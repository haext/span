"""Sub-devices hang off the panel by registry id, not by identifiers.

Home Assistant deprecated `via_device=(DOMAIN, serial)` and the unscoped
`async_get_device(identifiers=...)` together in 2026.8, for one reason: device
identifiers are unique only *within* a config entry, so anything treating them as
globally unique is ambiguous by construction. Both stop working in 2027.8.

The replacement is a registry id, which only exists once the panel device does.
That is the whole design constraint here — a sub-device cannot name its parent
until its parent is registered — and it is why setup resolves the id once and
carries it on the entry's runtime data instead of every platform looking it up.

The end-to-end test below is the one that matters. `via_device_id` naming a
device that does not exist is dropped by the registry rather than rejected, so a
wrong id threaded through these builders would not raise anywhere: the device
would simply appear unparented in the UI, which is exactly the kind of failure
a unit test asserting on a dict cannot see.
