"""An entity whose declared field could not be resolved reports unavailable.

The Repairs from `schema_repairs` explain and aggregate; this is the same fact
told where a user actually looks. It also mitigates the user-visible symptom of
the "absent property parses to 0.0 rather than None" defect *for the
resolution-failure case*: a field the adapter cannot resolve at all would
otherwise render as a live zero, which for a TOTAL_INCREASING energy sensor
reads as a counter reset. It does nothing for a field that resolves but stops
being published at runtime -- that needs the snapshot model to admit None.
