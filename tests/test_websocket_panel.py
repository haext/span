"""A device id saved before Home Assistant 2026.8 still names this panel.

2026.8 gave every device a single owning config entry. A device that belonged to
several was split into one device per entry, and every split was given a new id.
A SPAN panel was such a device whenever a helper built on one of its sensors -- a
utility meter, a Riemann integral -- had linked itself to the panel's device, which
helpers did until that release. The dashboard card keeps the device id it was
configured with, so it can send the old one.

The registry here is reached the way a real install reaches it: a pre-2026.8 store
is handed to Home Assistant's own migration, which performs the split and remaps
the battery's `via_device_id` onto the split its own entry owns. Both commands
must then resolve the old id to the panel device SPAN owns, whichever entry was
the old device's primary.
