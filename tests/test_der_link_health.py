"""The enclosure's link to each circuit-fed DER, as two diagnostic binary sensors.

`bess_connected` has shown the panel's view of the link to the battery since v1.0
landed, because the upstream lugs' `connection/fed-by-device-status` was already
read. The identical fact for a PV or a charger is published by the **circuit that
feeds it** — `connection/feeds-device-status`, the other half of the same
capability — and reached nothing, so one DER class had a link sensor and the
other two did not.

`pv_panel_link` and `evse_panel_link` close that.

**The naming is load-bearing.** `evse_ev_connected` already exists on the same
device and reads the charger's own `status/status`: *a vehicle is plugged in*.
The new one reads the feeding circuit's connection record: *the enclosure can
reach the charger*. Those are different questions with different answers, and
`test_the_charger_link_is_not_the_ev_plug` produces the state where they
disagree rather than asserting the distinction in prose.

**Every expectation is read out of the capture**, including the enum's members,
which come from the circuit's own `$description` `format` rather than from a list
written here. And the capture publishes `OK` on all three records, so no reading
is proved by the baseline alone: each is proved by republishing values that
differ per DER, and by swapping them, because two chargers fed by two circuits is
what makes cross-wiring falsifiable.

**Absence is a reading too.** Two of the capture's five circuits publish no
connection record at all — the enclosure data model calls that normal for a
mixed-load circuit, and the enum has no UNKNOWN member, so an unpublished
property is the only way a panel can say it does not know. The entity is gated on
the record existing, never on the circuit's type, and never treats silence as a
fault.
