"""The control lock's state across a reload, and what it is before there is one.

Separate from `test_control_gate.py` because these go through a real config
entry setup and a real `async_reload`. The gate tests construct the switch
against a mock coordinator and never add it to Home Assistant, so they cannot
see the entity lifecycle at all -- and the lifecycle is the whole subject here:
`ControlLock` is rebuilt by every `async_setup_entry`, and the only thing that
knows what the last run left behind is the entity.
