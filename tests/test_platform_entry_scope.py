"""Every platform hands the builders the entry it is setting up.

The builders look device cards up within the entry they are given, so the entry
a platform passes decides which card each lookup finds. Nothing about a wrong
entry is loud: an adopted device resolves to no card and is re-minted under a
new identifier, which the registry reads as an entity replacement that takes
the history with it, and an extension row finds no card and is deferred, so its
entity never appears. Each platform is set up here against an entry that
already holds the cards, and asked for the entity only the right entry yields.
