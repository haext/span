"""An entity this integration adds must not arrive silently, switched on or off.

`battery.part_number` shipped with `entity_registry_enabled_default=False` so
upgrading would not grow anybody's entity list uninvited. It worked, and the cost
was that nothing told the user the sensor existed -- they found it by opening the
device's disabled-entity list on a hunch.

The first fix covered only *disabled* additions, on the reasoning that an enabled
one is already visible in the entity list and its history. That reasoning does
not survive contact with how anyone uses Home Assistant: nobody watches their
entity count, so an addition that breaks nothing is indistinguishable from no
addition at all. These cover both, and the four ways the announcement could be
worse than nothing -- shouting on a first install, shouting a release's worth of
history on upgrade, nagging on every restart, or naming a hundred entities at
once.
