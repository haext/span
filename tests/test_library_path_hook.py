"""The commit-time gate on `pyproject.toml`'s library paths must actually fire.

`scripts/check-library-path.py` runs on every commit that touches
`pyproject.toml` and rejects a `span-panel-api` path naming anything but
`../../span/span-panel-api`. It exists because `3cbf02a` pointed both blocks that
decide where the library comes from at a scratch worktree and committed it, and
nothing noticed for several commits.

Tested for the same reason `tests/test_dependency_sync.py` exists: a hook that
matches nothing produces no output, and no output is indistinguishable from a
clean tree.

Two things this file is careful about, because getting either wrong would leave a
gate that is only proven against itself.

**It drives the real entry point.** Every case runs
`scripts/check-library-path.py` as a subprocess and reads its exit status and
output, exactly as prek invokes it -- never the module's functions, and never a
reimplementation of the rule in the test. A test that reimplements the logic
proves the test's copy of the logic. `test_the_hook_prek_runs_is_the_one_tested`
closes the remaining gap by reading the entry out of `prek.toml`: a hook renamed
there and not here would otherwise go unregistered while these tests kept passing.

**The failing cases are the real files.** `tests/fixtures/pyproject_*.toml` are
byte copies of `pyproject.toml` at the two commits where this actually went
wrong, taken straight out of this repository's history and held to it by
`test_the_vendored_copies_are_the_commits_they_name`. A gate proven against a
made-up example is proven against the wrong thing: the synthetic version of a
defect is written by someone who already knows what the rule checks, so it
exercises the rule rather than the mistake. The two states nothing in history
provides -- an absent `[tool.uv.sources]` block, an `extraPaths` naming only
unrelated repositories -- are the only ones constructed here.

Lives here rather than beside the script in `tests/scripts/`, which `pytest.ini`
excludes with `norecursedirs`. A test that is never collected is the same failure
as a hook that never matches.
