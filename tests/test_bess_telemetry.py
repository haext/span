"""What the BESS reports about itself, surfaced as two sensors on its own device.

`meter/active-power` and `status/communication-state` were declared, published
and read by nobody. They are the battery's own view of its power and its own view
of its link, as opposed to the enclosure's view of both.

Every assertion runs against a real snapshot built by the real schema_1 adapter
over the reference capture, and every expected value is read out of that capture
rather than written as a literal — a test that pins the same constant the code
pins passes whether or not the wire is ever read. Each reading is proved by
republishing it, deleting it, or dropping the node that carries it.

**The sign is the hard part, and it is what most of this module is about.** The
capture is of a *charging* battery, published as a positive `meter/active-power`
because the enclosure meters the BESS the way it meters a circuit it feeds, in a
frame where positive means power flowing *into* the thing being metered. Each
path applies exactly one negation — the snapshot negates the BESS's own meter,
and `battery_power` negates the enclosure's `power-flows/battery` — so both
sensors land on the same convention in the UI, reading negative for this charging
battery. A sensor whose sign contradicted the one beside it would be worse than
no sensor, so the agreement is asserted directly rather than inferred from the
two definitions.

**The agreement is structural; the direction is inherited from the fixture.**
The capture is in the frame firmware through r202633 publishes: both wire
properties carry the *same* sign as each other and each path applies exactly one
negation, so the two entities cannot disagree whatever the convention. The tests
that read the capture unmodified are scoped to that frame; r202639, which
publishes the BESS meter as the flow's negation, has its own section at the end
of the sign tests. That is what the agreement assertions below pin, and it holds
independently of which way is charging. Neither negation changed here:
`BATTERY_POWER_SENSOR` is the single negation it has been since 2.0.8, and what a
real panel displays depends on what that panel publishes, not on this fixture.

Which way *is* charging is read off the reference capture, and the capture now
carries the post-`distribution-enclosure-simulator#39` frame: `power-flows` 0.3
defines the node balance as every term positive when power flows into the thing
it names, so `pv` is negative while producing and the four terms sum to zero.
The capture this module was first written against predated that fix and satisfied
`grid + pv + battery == site` instead, which is why these assertions read the
other way until span-panel-api re-captured the reference tree. The library pins
the same four values and states the same frame (`test_schema_one_panel.py`,
`test_power_flows`). Refresh the fixture and revisit these assertions together;
do not change one without the other.

    instead — `pv + battery + grid == site`, with `grid` positive when importing —
