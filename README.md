The software is provided as-is with no warranty or guarantee of performance or suitability to your particular setting.

**IMPORTANT:** This integration controls real electrical equipment. Circuit switches open and close physical relays. The GFE override button changes how the
panel manages load shedding during power outages. These actions carry the same consequences as operating the panel manually — because they are. Automations can
execute these actions without user presence; design them with the same care you would apply to any unattended electrical control. This integration is not a
safety device and must not be relied upon for life-safety applications. Use this software at your own risk. If you cannot accept that risk, do not use this
software. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full warranty disclaimer.

The SPAN Client documentation has warnings regarding the use of the API (the API used by this integration) which should be heeded just as if you were using that
API directly:

> An API client that attempts to implement its own load-shedding decisions, grid-state detection, or other critical automation is operating outside the scope of
> what SPAN API was designed and engineered for. Such use is entirely at the client developer's and homeowner's own risk and may void the SPAN Panel Limited
> Warranty. See the SPAN API Scope & Responsibility Model in the [SPAN API documentation](https://github.com/spanio/SPAN-API-Client-Docs).

This integration provides sensors and controls for understanding an installation's power consumption, energy usage, and controlling user-manageable panel
circuits.

The integration includes a built-in dashboard accessible from the Home Assistant sidebar, providing real-time circuit-level power visualization, current
monitoring with configurable alerts, and circuit settings for relays and load shedding. See [Frontend Dashboard](frontend.md) for details. You can optionally
use the [span-card](https://github.com/SpanPanel/span-card) Lovelace card for visualization and switch control.

The [SPAN Panel Simulator](https://github.com/SpanPanel/simulator) HA App lets you clone your panel's circuit layout for testing, or model an upgrade to
evaluate firmware or integration changes in a sandbox before applying them to your real panel.

This integration communicates with the SPAN Panel over your local network using SPAN's official
[Electrification Bus (eBus)](https://github.com/spanio/SPAN-API-Client-Docs) framework — an open, multi-vendor integration standard for home energy
infrastructure. eBus uses the [Homie Convention](https://homieiot.github.io/) for MQTT topics and messages, with the panel's built-in MQTT broker delivering
real-time state updates without polling.

## 1.1.x Integration Sunset (v1)

Users MUST upgrade by the end of 2026 to avoid disruption. Upgrade to the latest 1.1.x version BEFORE upgrading to 2.0.x.

## 2.0.x Breaking Changes (v2)

**Do NOT upgrade unless your panel is running firmware `spanos2/r202603/05` or later.**

**What you need:**

- SPAN Panel firmware `spanos2/r202603/05` or later
- Panel passphrase (found in the SPAN mobile app, On-premise settings) **or** physical access to the panel door for proof-of-proximity authentication

**Breaking:**

- Requires firmware `spanos2/r202603/05` or later — panels on older firmware will not work
- `Cellular` binary sensor removed — replaced by `Vendor Cloud` sensor

> Running older firmware? See [v1 Legacy Documentation](v1-legacy.md).

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for all additions or value changes.

## Prerequisites

- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) installed
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed
- SPAN Panel with firmware `spanos2/r202603/05` or later
- SPAN Panel integration v1.3.0 or later
- Panel passphrase (found via the SPAN app) **or** physical access to the panel door

## Installation

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
2. Go to HACS in the left side bar of your Home Assistant installation
3. Search for "Span"
4. Open the repository and click "Download"
5. Restart Home Assistant (you will be prompted by a repair notification)
6. Go to `Settings` > `Devices & Services`
7. Click `+ Add Integration` and search for "Span"
8. Enter the IP address of your SPAN Panel
9. The integration detects the panel as v2 and presents an authentication choice:
   - **Enter Panel Passphrase** — type the passphrase found in the SPAN mobile app under On-premise settings
   - **Proof of Proximity** — open and close the panel door 3 times, then click Submit
10. Choose your entity naming pattern
11. Optionally adjust the snapshot update interval — 0 is real-time, up to 15 seconds based on CPU

### Upgrade Process

When upgrading through HACS:

1. **Create a backup** of your Home Assistant configuration and database
2. **Review the changes** in this README and CHANGELOG
3. **Check your automations** — review any references to removed entities
4. **Update during a quiet period** when you can monitor the upgrade

If you encounter issues, restore from your backup or check the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below.

## Key Terms

The following terms appear throughout this document and in the integration's sensors:

- **Grid-forming entity (GFE)** — The power source that sets the voltage and frequency reference for the home. When the utility grid is up, it is the GFE. When
  islanded on battery, the battery inverter becomes the GFE.
- **Islanded** — The home is electrically disconnected from the utility grid and running on its own power source, typically battery. Circuits may be shed to
  conserve battery life.
- **Microgrid** — When the home is islanded, the battery inverter creates a small, self-contained electrical grid for the home. This local grid functions
  independently of the utility — the inverter generates AC power at the correct voltage and frequency, and the home's circuits run on it just as they would on
  utility power.
- **Microgrid Interconnect Device (MID)** — A switch, part of or alongside the battery system, that disconnects the home from the utility grid during an outage.
  While open, the panel's sensors can only see the home side.
- **Shedding** — Automatically turning off lower-priority circuits to conserve battery during an outage, based on each circuit's configured shed priority.

### EVSE (EV Charger) Entities

Created automatically when a SPAN Drive or other EVSE is commissioned on the panel. Each EVSE appears as a separate sub-device linked to the panel via
`via_device`. Vendor, product, serial number, and software version are surfaced as device info attributes — not separate entities.

#### EVSE Device Naming

The EVSE device name includes the panel device name prefix for collision avoidance across multi-panel installations and to support HA's bulk device rename
feature. A display suffix differentiates multiple chargers on the same panel:

- **Friendly names** (`USE_CIRCUIT_NUMBERS=False`): suffix is the fed circuit's panel name (e.g., "Garage")
- **Circuit numbers** (`USE_CIRCUIT_NUMBERS=True`): suffix is the EVSE serial number (e.g., "SN-EVSE-001")
- **No suffix available**: the display suffix is omitted entirely (no empty parentheses)

| Naming Mode     | Example Device Name                   | Example Entity ID                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Friendly names  | `Main House SPAN Drive (Garage)`      | `sensor.main_house_span_drive_garage_charger_status`      |
| Circuit numbers | `Main House SPAN Drive (SN-EVSE-001)` | `sensor.main_house_span_drive_sn_evse_001_charger_status` |
| No suffix       | `Main House SPAN Drive`               | `sensor.main_house_span_drive_charger_status`             |

#### EVSE Sensors (per charger)

| Sensor             | Device Class | Unit | Notes                                                                            |

| EV Connected | Plug             | ON when status is PREPARING, CHARGING, SUSPENDED\_\*, or FINISHING |

#### EVSE Device Info Attributes

| Attribute        | Source             |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Manufacturer     | `vendor-name`      |
| Model            | `product-name`     |
| Serial Number    | `serial-number`    |
| Software Version | `software-version` |

### BESS Sub-Device (v2 only, conditional)

When a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is commissioned, the integration creates a separate BESS sub-device linked to the panel via `via_device`. The BESS
device uses manufacturer, model, serial number, and software version from battery metadata as device info attributes.

### BESS & Grid Management

This section explains how the SPAN panel manages power sources and load shedding when a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is installed, and what the
integration can and cannot tell you about grid status.

#### Grid Forming Entity

The Grid Forming Entity (GFE) sensor identifies which power source provides the voltage and frequency reference for the home — not which source is producing the
most watts. When GFE is Grid, the utility grid sets the reference and all circuits remain on, even if 100% of consumption comes from solar. When GFE is Battery,
the battery inverter is the reference and circuits are shed based on each circuit's configured shed priority.

| GFE Value | Meaning                                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GRID      | Panel is grid-connected (includes generator power, see deep dive) |
| BATTERY   | Panel is islanded, running on battery                             |
| PV        | Panel is islanded, running on solar (future)                      |
| GENERATOR | Panel is islanded, running on generator (future)                  |
| NONE      | Panel is islanded with no power source                            |
| UNKNOWN   | State not yet determined or fault condition                       |

When a BESS is installed, the panel relies on the BESS to determine whether the grid is online and to set the GFE accordingly. If BESS communication is lost
while the panel is islanded, the GFE value becomes stale — it may show Battery when the grid has actually been restored, causing unnecessary shedding to
continue.

#### What the Panel Can Detect

**Grid loss** — The panel independently detects grid loss via its own voltage monitoring, even if BESS communication is already lost. The MID is still closed at
this point, so the panel's sensors see the real voltage drop and respond immediately.

**Grid restoration while islanded** — Not detectable by the panel. While the MID is open, the panel's sensors are on the home side and measure only
battery-supplied power. Grid restoration on the utility side of the open MID is invisible to any panel-side measurement. This is a physical limitation, not a
software gap. A utility-side sensor — such as a current clamp (e.g., Emporia Vue), ATS/MTS contact closure, or any device that can see the grid side of the MID
— integrated into Home Assistant as a binary sensor can provide this signal.

#### DSM State Sensor

The integration's `DSM State` sensor combines multiple panel signals to provide defense-in-depth for grid status detection. It corroborates the Grid Forming
Entity with BESS grid state and power measurements, which adds confidence during transient inconsistencies and detects some edge cases — for example, when BESS
communication is lost while on-grid and the grid subsequently drops, the panel self-corrects via voltage detection and the corroborating signals confirm it.

However, when the panel is islanded and the MID is open, all of the panel's signals measure the home side. No combination of panel-sourced data can detect grid
restoration in this state. Only an external signal (utility-side sensor) or manual confirmation via the GFE Override button can resolve it.

#### GFE Override Button

The **GFE Override: Grid Connected** button tells the panel that the grid is back and shedding can stop. When the BESS restores communication, it automatically
reclaims control and the override is superseded — no manual undo is needed.

**Risk asymmetry** — Telling the panel to shed (conservative direction) is low-risk; worst case is unnecessary circuit disruption. Telling the panel the grid is
back when it is not means unmanaged battery drain and reduced runtime, which could affect critical equipment. The battery protects itself by disconnecting when
depleted, so there is no overload risk, but runtime will be reduced. Use the override button only with confidence that the grid has actually been restored — via
a utility-side sensor or manual confirmation.

**WARNING** — Do _not_ automate the GFE override button based on `DSM State` — it inherits the same MID blind spot described above and will read `dsm_off_grid`
even after the grid is restored. Manual confirmation or an external sensor is required before pressing the button.

When `bess_connected` returns to on, no action is needed — firmware resumes normal GFE management automatically.

[BESS & Grid Management Deep Dive](bess-grid-management.md).

## Configuration Options

### Snapshot Update Interval

Controls how often the integration rebuilds the panel snapshot from incoming MQTT data. The SPAN panel publishes high-frequency MQTT messages (~100/second), but
each individual message is a cheap dictionary write. The expensive operation — rebuilding the full snapshot and dispatching entity updates — is rate-limited by
this timer.

- **Default:** 1 second
- **Range:** 0–15 seconds
- **Set to 0** for no debounce (every MQTT message triggers a snapshot rebuild)
- **Increase on low-power hardware** (e.g., Raspberry Pi) to reduce CPU usage

Configure via `Settings` > `Devices & Services` > `SPAN Panel` > `Configure` > `General Options`.

### Entity Naming Pattern

The integration provides flexible entity naming patterns, configured during initial setup:

1. **Friendly Names** (Recommended for new installations)
   - Entity IDs use descriptive circuit names from your SPAN panel
   - Example: `sensor.span_panel_kitchen_outlets_power`
   - Automatically updates when you rename circuits in the SPAN panel
   - More intuitive for automations and scripts

2. **Circuit Numbers** (Stable entity IDs)
   - Entity IDs use generic circuit numbers
   - Example: `sensor.span_panel_circuit_15_power`
   - Entity IDs remain stable even when circuits are renamed
   - Friendly names still sync from SPAN panel for display

### Energy Dip Compensation

SPAN panels occasionally report lower energy readings for cumulative energy sensors after firmware updates or resets. Home Assistant's statistics engine
interprets any decrease as a counter reset, creating negative spikes in the energy dashboard.

When enabled, the integration automatically detects these dips and maintains a cumulative offset per sensor so Home Assistant always sees a monotonically
increasing value.

- **Default for new installs:** ON
- **Default for existing installs:** OFF (enable via General Options)
- **Threshold:** 1.0 Wh minimum to avoid false triggers from float precision noise
- **Disabling:** Clears all accumulated offsets (starts fresh if re-enabled)

When a dip is detected, a persistent notification lists the affected sensors and their dip amounts.

**Diagnostic attributes** (visible when compensation is active):

| Attribute        | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `energy_offset`  | Cumulative Wh compensation applied (when > 0) |
| `last_dip_delta` | Size of the most recent dip in Wh             |

Configure via `Settings` > `Devices & Services` > `SPAN Panel` > `Configure` > `General Options`.

### Customizing Entity Precision

The power sensors report with the exact precision from the SPAN panel, which may be more decimal places than you need. By default, sensors display with
precision 2 (e.g., `0.00`), except battery percentage which uses precision 0 (e.g., `39`).

You can change the display precision for any entity via `Settings` > `Devices & Services` > `Entities` tab. Find the entity, click on it, click the gear wheel,
and select your preferred precision from the "Display Precision" menu.

## WebSocket API

The integration provides a `span_panel/panel_topology` WebSocket command that returns the full physical layout of a panel in a single call — circuits with their
breaker slot positions, entity IDs grouped by role, and sub-devices (BESS, EVSE) with their entities.

See [WebSocket API Reference](websocket-api.md) for the full schema, response format, and usage examples.

| **Energy Dashboard spikes after firmware updates**  | Huge energy-consumption spikes after panel firmware updates; charts showing untracked values that dwarf normal usage; negative energy values in statistics. Caused by the panel reporting decreased values on otherwise `TOTAL_INCREASING` sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Prevention:** enable [Energy Dip Compensation](#energy-dip-compensation) in General Options (on by default for new installs). **Fix existing spikes:** in **Developer Tools → Statistics**, search for the affected sensor (e.g. `sensor.span_panel_main_meter_consumed_energy`) and use **Adjust sum** to correct the errant entry. The integration also notifies when a decrease in the main meter consumed sensor is detected. |
| **High CPU usage**                                  | Elevated CPU on low-power hardware (e.g. Raspberry Pi). The integration rebuilds a full panel snapshot from MQTT messages at a configurable interval (default 1 s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Increase **Snapshot Update Interval** in **General Options**. 10–15 s is recommended for resource-constrained systems. Setting it to 0 disables debouncing and rebuilds on every MQTT message — not recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Replaced sub-device shows the old serial number** | After replacing a SPAN sub-device (Drive / EVSE, BESS, PV inverter), the device entry in Home Assistant keeps showing the previous hardware's serial number. The integration keys entities off the panel-assigned node identity, which is intentionally stable across hardware swaps so long-term history (e.g. lifetime charging kWh for a Drive) is preserved. The device-registry serial number, however, does not auto-refresh. | In **Settings → Devices & Services → Span Panel**, open the affected sub-device and delete it, then reload the integration (or restart Home Assistant). The device re-registers with the new serial number. Entity IDs and their recorded history are preserved.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Door sensor unavailable**                         | The SPAN API returns UNKNOWN if the cabinet door has not been operated recently. This is a defect in the SPAN API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The integration reports the sensor as unavailable until a proper value arrives.
