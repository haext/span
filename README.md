The software is provided as-is with no warranty or guarantee of performance or suitability to your particular setting.

**IMPORTANT:** This integration controls real electrical equipment. Circuit switches open and close physical relays. The GFE override button changes how the
panel manages load shedding during power outages. These actions carry the same consequences as operating the panel manually — because they are. Automations can
execute these actions without user presence; design them with the same care you would apply to any unattended electrical control. This integration is not a
safety device and must not be relied upon for life-safety applications. Use this software at your own risk. If you cannot accept that risk, do not use this
software. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full warranty disclaimer.

The SPAN Client documentation has warnings regarding the use of the API (the API used by this integration) which should be heeded just as if you were using that
API directly:

> An API client that attempts to implement its own load-shedding decisions, grid-state detection, or other critical automation is operating outside the scope of
> what SPAN API was designed and engineered for. Such use is entirely at the client developer's and homeowner's own risk and may void the SPAN Panel Limited
> Warranty. See the SPAN API Scope & Responsibility Model in the [SPAN API documentation](https://github.com/spanio/SPAN-API-Client-Docs).

This integration provides sensors and controls for understanding an installation's power consumption, energy usage, and controlling user-manageable panel
circuits.

The integration includes a built-in dashboard accessible from the Home Assistant sidebar, providing real-time circuit-level power visualization, current
monitoring with configurable alerts, and circuit settings for relays and load shedding. See [Frontend Dashboard](frontend.md) for details. You can optionally
use the [span-card](https://github.com/SpanPanel/span-card) Lovelace card for visualization and switch control.

The [SPAN Panel PanelBench](https://github.com/SpanPanel/panelbench) HA App lets you clone your panel's circuit layout for testing, or model an upgrade to
evaluate firmware or integration changes in a sandbox before applying them to your real panel.

This integration communicates with the SPAN Panel over your local network using SPAN's official
[Electrification Bus (eBus)](https://github.com/spanio/SPAN-API-Client-Docs) framework — an open, multi-vendor integration standard for home energy
infrastructure. eBus uses the [Homie Convention](https://homieiot.github.io/) for MQTT topics and messages, with the panel's built-in MQTT broker delivering
real-time state updates without polling.

## Prerequisites

- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) installed
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed
- SPAN Panel with firmware `spanos2/r202603/05` or later
- Panel passphrase (found via the SPAN app) **or** physical access to the panel door

## Installation

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
2. Go to HACS in the left side bar of your Home Assistant installation
3. Search for "Span"
4. Open the repository and click "Download"
5. Restart Home Assistant (you will be prompted by a repair notification)
6. Go to `Settings` > `Devices & Services`
7. Click `+ Add Integration` and search for "Span"
8. Pick your panel from the discovered list, or enter its IP address or `.local` name (both shown in the mobile app)
9. The integration detects the panel as v2 and presents an authentication choice:
   - **Enter Panel Passphrase** — type the passphrase found in the SPAN mobile app under On-premise settings
   - **Proof of Proximity** — open and close the panel door 3 times, then click Submit
10. Choose your entity ID naming pattern (see naming patterns below)
11. Optionally adjust the snapshot update interval — 0 is real-time, up to 15 seconds based on CPU

If you encounter issues, restore from your backup or check the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below.

## Key Terms

The following terms appear throughout this document and in the integration's sensors:

- **Grid-forming entity (GFE)** — The power source that sets the voltage and frequency reference for the home. When the utility grid is up, it is the GFE. When
  islanded on battery, the battery inverter becomes the GFE.
- **Islanded** — The home is electrically disconnected from the utility grid and running on its own power source, typically battery. Circuits may be shed to
  conserve battery life.
- **Microgrid** — When the home is islanded, the battery inverter creates a small, self-contained electrical grid for the home. This local grid functions
  independently of the utility — the inverter generates AC power at the correct voltage and frequency, and the home's circuits run on it just as they would on
  utility power.
- **Microgrid Interconnect Device (MID)** — A switch, part of or alongside the battery system, that disconnects the home from the utility grid during an outage.
  While open, the panel's sensors can only see the home side.
- **Shedding** — Automatically turning off lower-priority circuits to conserve battery during an outage, based on each circuit's configured shed priority.

### Panel Diagnostic Sensors

| Sensor                | Device Class | Unit | Notes                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| L1 Voltage            | Voltage      | V    | L1 leg actual voltage                                             |
| L2 Voltage            | Voltage      | V    | L2 leg actual voltage                                             |
| Upstream L1 Current   | Current      | A    | Upstream lugs L1 current                                          |
| Upstream L2 Current   | Current      | A    | Upstream lugs L2 current                                          |
| Downstream L1 Current | Current      | A    | Downstream lugs L1 current. Off by default from 2.1.x — see below |
| Downstream L2 Current | Current      | A    | Downstream lugs L2 current. Off by default from 2.1.x — see below |
| Main Breaker Rating   | Current      | A    | Main breaker amperage. Off by default                             |

L1/L2 Voltage and Main Breaker Rating have always been off by default; enable them from the panel's device page if you want them.

**The three Feedthrough sensors and the two Downstream current sensors are off by default from 2.1.x.** The eBus specification's maintainer has documented that
the panel's feedthrough (downstream lugs) figures cannot be relied on: the energy registers can decrease or go negative, the power reading is inverted relative
to every other terminal, and the downstream currents report the **upstream** service conductors. The defects predate `r202633`.

Existing installations keep all five, with their history and entity ids — Home Assistant applies the setting only when an entity is first created. If you use
them somewhere, removing them is worth considering, but that is your call.

### Shed Forecast Sensors

Created only when your panel publishes the `shed-forecast` capability, and only for the estimates it actually publishes.

| Sensor                | Device Class | Unit | Notes                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time to Priority Shed | Duration     | min  | Estimated time before the next priority tier of circuits is shed |
| Backup Time Remaining | Duration     | min  | Estimated time before every sheddable circuit is shed (off-grid) |

#### Shed Forecast Sensor Attributes

Present only when the panel publishes them.

| Attribute                           | Type   | On                    | Notes                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `full_charge_time_to_priority_shed` | int    | Time to Priority Shed | The same estimate assuming the battery starts full    |
| `full_charge_total_time_remaining`  | int    | Backup Time Remaining | The same estimate assuming the battery starts full    |
| `forecast_confidence`               | string | both                  | The panel's own assessment:`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH` |

### Power Control System Sensors

Created only when your panel publishes the `pcs` capability, and created whether or not the PCS is switched on — a PCS reporting a limit of 0 A is reporting a
state, not an absence.

| Sensor             | Device Class | Unit | Notes                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Import Limit       | Current      | A    | The limit actually being enforced: the most restrictive active constraint (diagnostic)                                     |
| Binding Constraint | Enum         | —    | Which constraint sets that limit: Firm Service Rating, Grid Envelope, Voltage Support, Off-Grid, Requested, Operator, None |

#### Power Control System Sensor Attributes

On **Import Limit**, and present only when the panel publishes them. These are the inputs the panel reconciled to produce the enforced limit above.

| Attribute                | Type   | Notes                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pcs_enabled`            | bool   | Whether the panel's PCS is enabled at all                      |
| `feed_import_limit`      | float  | The Firm Service Rating: the commissioned, always-on floor (A) |
| `operator_import_limit`  | float  | A cap imposed by a fleet or aggregator operator (A)            |
| `off_grid_import_limit`  | float  | The import cap while islanded (A)                              |
| `requested_import_limit` | float  | A voluntary limit requested by the owner or installer (A)      |
| `<name>_enablement`      | string | Per limit:`UNSPECIFIED`, `UNCONFIGURED`, `DISABLED`, `ENABLED` |
| `<name>_active`          | bool   | Per limit: whether that constraint is currently enforcing      |

### Power Flow Sensors

| Sensor        | Device Class | Unit | Notes                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grid Power    | Power        | W    | Grid power flow                                                                     |
| Site Power    | Power        | W    | Total site power (grid + PV + battery)                                              |
| Battery Power | Power        | W    | Battery charge/discharge (**+discharging, −charging**). Only when BESS commissioned |
| PV Power      | Power        | W    | PV generation (+producing). Only when PV commissioned                               |

### PV Metadata Sensors (on the Solar sub-device)

From 2.1.x these live on a **Solar** device of their own rather than on the panel's card, alongside PV Power and PV Panel Link.

| Sensor             | Device Class | Unit | Notes                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PV Vendor          | —            | —    | PV inverter vendor (e.g., "Enphase", "Other")                                        |
| PV Product         | —            | —    | PV inverter product (e.g., "IQ8+")                                                   |
| Nameplate Capacity | —            | W    | DC array size recorded at installation; informational, never a limit. Off by default |

If you upgraded, these keep their entity ids, unique ids and history — but not the panel's area, since an entity takes its area from its device and the Solar
device starts without one. Assign it an area, or anything area-scoped (dashboards, automations, voice targeting a room) stops matching them. New installations
get ids from the new device name — `sensor.span_panel_solar_pv_vendor` rather than `sensor.span_panel_pv_vendor`. Both are correct and neither changes again.

Each additional solar inverter (published from firmware r202639) gets a **Solar Inverter** device of its own, named after the circuit that feeds it where one
does, with its own PV Vendor, PV Product and Nameplate Capacity, and its PV Panel Link where the panel reports one. The PV entities on the **Solar** device
never move: they keep describing the inverter they always did, beside PV Power, the panel's total. Where the panel cannot say which inverter they described — an
inverter no circuit feeds, for example behind a Tesla Gateway, or several already reported when you upgraded — they describe all of your inverters together. An
inverter device the panel no longer reports stays, unavailable, until you delete it. Each inverter's power is the power of the circuit that feeds it, which the
SPAN Panel card shows on that inverter's tile. An inverter no circuit feeds, such as one upstream of the panel, has no individual reading; its output is
included in PV Power, the panel's total. The card's Solar tile shows its inverter's circuit and the site total together; on a single-inverter site the two are
usually close.

**Deprecated:**

| Sensor         | Reason                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DSM Grid State | Deprecated — still available, but users should rely on`DSM State` as `DSM Grid State` may be removed in a future version |

### Microgrid Interconnect Device

Your panel publishes its Microgrid Interconnect Device — the switch that disconnects your home from the utility during an outage — as a device of its own,
linked to the panel. It appears automatically where the panel reports one; nothing existing moves onto it.

| Sensor     | Device Class | Unit | Notes                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grid State | Enum         | —    | Health of the utility supply itself:`up`, `down`, `degraded` or `unknown` |

This is new information — the previous firmware did not report the utility supply at all. It is not **DSM Grid State**, which is whether **your home** is
islanded: the grid can be down while your home runs happily off the battery.

**A panel with no battery has no MID, and that is itself an answer.** The specification makes backup capability structural — having a MID is what says a panel
can island — so **Grid Islandable** reads `Off` and **Grid Forming Entity** reads `Grid` rather than either going unavailable.

`DSM Grid State` keeps its entity id and history but is no longer inferred from the battery or the dominant power source; it now reads the islanding state the
MID actually senses, or your GFE override while the panel is acting on one.

### Power Sensor Attributes

Applies to Current Power, Feed Through Power, Battery Power, PV Power, Grid Power, and Site Power sensors.

| Attribute  | Type   | Notes                                |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `voltage`  | string | Nominal panel voltage ("240")        |
| `amperage` | string | Calculated current (power / voltage) |

**Grid Power** carries one more, because its name is only true in some wiring:

| Attribute             | Type    | Notes                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `at_service_entrance` | boolean | Whether this panel's upstream lugs are where the utility actually connects |

Grid Power reads the upstream lugs. That is grid flow when those lugs are the utility connection point, which is the ordinary case. Put a battery between the
utility and your main lugs, or feed this panel from another panel, and the same reading becomes **this panel's** supply while **Grid Power Flow** stays the
whole-site figure — so the two legitimately disagree. When `at_service_entrance` is `false`, use Grid Power Flow for site-level grid import and export.

### Software Version Sensor Attributes

| Attribute    | Type | Notes                               |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| `panel_size` | int  | Total breaker spaces (e.g., 32, 40) |

`wifi_ssid` used to appear here. It moved to the Wi-Fi Link binary sensor below; a template reading it from this sensor should be pointed there.

### Wi-Fi Link Binary Sensor Attributes

| Attribute   | Type   | Notes                                                            |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wifi_ssid` | string | Network this link is to. Absent when the panel publishes no SSID |

### EVSE (EV Charger) Entities

Created automatically when a SPAN Drive or other EVSE is commissioned on the panel. Each EVSE appears as a separate sub-device linked to the panel via
`via_device`. Vendor, product, serial number, and software version are surfaced as device info attributes — not separate entities.

#### EVSE Device Naming

The EVSE device name includes the panel device name prefix for collision avoidance across multi-panel installations and to support HA's bulk device rename
feature. A display suffix differentiates multiple chargers on the same panel:

- **Friendly names** (`USE_CIRCUIT_NUMBERS=False`): suffix is the fed circuit's panel name (e.g., "Garage")
- **Circuit numbers** (`USE_CIRCUIT_NUMBERS=True`): suffix is the EVSE serial number (e.g., "SN-EVSE-001")
- **No suffix available**: the display suffix is omitted entirely (no empty parentheses)

| Naming Mode     | Example Device Name                   | Example Entity ID                                         |

The circuit that feeds a charger has its sensors shown on the charger's device. Their entity IDs name the charger alone —
`sensor.main_house_span_drive_garage_power` — matching the charger's other sensors. A feed sensor you already have keeps its current id until you press
**Recreate entity IDs**, which offers the charger-named one.

#### EVSE Binary Sensors (per charger)

| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Charging        | Battery Charging | ON when status is CHARGING                                                                       |
| EV Connected    | Plug             | ON when status is PREPARING, CHARGING, SUSPENDED\_\*, or FINISHING — a vehicle is plugged in     |
| EVSE Panel Link | Connectivity     | Whether the panel can reach the charger. A different fact from EV Connected, and it can disagree |

**EVSE Panel Link is not EV Connected.** EV Connected is what the charger says about the cable in front of it; EVSE Panel Link is what the panel says about
whether it can reach the charger at all. A charger part-way through a session behind a lost link reports a plugged-in vehicle and a dead link at the same time.
EVSE Panel Link is a diagnostic and appears only where the circuit feeding that charger publishes the link record.

#### EVSE Controls (per charger)

| Control                   | Platform | Unit | Notes                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EVSE Charge Current Limit | Number   | A    | The charge-current ceiling you can lower. Bounded by the installer-commissioned maximum |

The maximum is read from the panel, never assumed: it is the current the charger was commissioned for, and a value above it is refused rather than clamped. The
control is created only where the panel declares the limit settable, and reports unavailable while the panel has not published the commissioned maximum that
bounds it. A change the panel has acknowledged but not yet applied appears as a `charge_current_limit_target` attribute while the state stays the limit the
charger is still enforcing.

#### EVSE Device Info Attributes

### BESS Sub-Device (conditional)

When a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is commissioned, the integration creates a separate BESS sub-device linked to the panel via `via_device`. The BESS
device uses manufacturer, model, serial number, and software version from battery metadata as device info attributes.

### Adopted Devices and Readings

The eBus schema is vendor-extensible, so your panel can publish a device type this integration has never modeled. Rather than ignoring it, the integration gives
it a card of its own hanging off the panel, carrying whatever identity it publishes, with its readings as entities beneath it.

Everything adopted arrives **disabled** and **filed under Diagnostics until you promote it** from the dashboard [Adopted tab](#the-adopted-tab); the new-entity
notification names the device so you can find it. A property the device accepts writes to becomes a control rather than a reading — a `boolean` becomes a
switch, an enumeration becomes a select, a number becomes a number entity — and those arrive switched off too.

Three things worth knowing before you build on one:

- **Nothing adopted enters long-term statistics until you say it should.** Adopted entities arrive with no statistics class, because the correct one is not
  published on the wire. You are welcome to supply it in the [Adopted tab](#the-adopted-tab).
- **A new property on a device this integration already models is adopted too**, but as a reading on that device's existing card rather than as a device of its
  own.
- **What the delete button does**, since it is not quite what you would expect:

  - Delete a reading while your panel is still publishing that property and it comes back — switched off — at the next reload, carrying whatever you curated for
    it. Curation is keyed on the wire address rather than on the entity, so deleting the entity does not discard it. There is no setting to suppress the entity,
    because leaving it switched off is already that.
  - Delete one after your panel has stopped publishing it and it stays gone, because nothing exists to recreate it from.

So deletion means "hide it until next time" for a live reading and "clear it out" for a dead one, and your panel decides which.

**These entities are permanent in id, not in identity.** If one of these readings is later modeled properly (delivered as an official part of the integration),
that entity is a new entity with its own id and its own history — the adopted one is not renamed into it. That is why a vendor reading you have come to depend
on is worth raising in an issue: being modeled is what turns it into something with a real name, a proper category and statistics out of the box.

### The Adopted Tab

The integration will not guess what an adopted reading means. You are not guessing — it is your device — so the built-in dashboard has an **Adopted** tab where
you can tell the integration about the reading.

A row that arrived as a control rather than a reading — a switch, a select or a number box — offers prominence alone, because a device class and a statistics
class both describe a value being read.

You are only offered choices your panel's own declaration allows. A statistics class is offered only on a reading whose declared datatype is numeric; the device
classes listed are the ones that fit both what the panel says the reading is and the unit it publishes, so a text reading is never offered a class that expects
a number, and the unit itself stays whatever the publisher sends.

**Saving reloads the integration**, and setting or clearing a statistics class asks you to confirm before it does.

Two consequences are what that confirmation is about:

- **`total_increasing` tells Home Assistant the reading is a meter that only counts up.** The recorder treats a drop of more than a tenth as the meter being
  reset and starts a new cycle, so choosing it for a reading that legitimately falls will manufacture consumption that never happened. Choose it only for a
  genuine lifetime total.
- **Removing a statistics class stops statistics, and Home Assistant will say so.** If an entity already has statistics and then loses its statistics class,
  Home Assistant raises a repair notice against it — a warning rather than something with a fix button — and stops compiling new statistics for it. The
  statistics already collected are not deleted, and the notice clears by itself if you put a statistics class back.

### BESS & Grid Management

This section explains how the SPAN panel manages power sources and load shedding when a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is installed, and what the
integration can and cannot tell you about grid status.

#### Grid Forming Entity

The Grid Forming Entity (GFE) sensor identifies which power source provides the voltage and frequency reference for the home — not which source is producing the
most watts. When GFE is Grid, the utility grid sets the reference and all circuits remain on, even if 100% of consumption comes from solar. When GFE is Battery,
the battery inverter is the reference and circuits are shed based on each circuit's configured shed priority.

| GFE Value | Meaning                                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GRID      | Panel is grid-connected (includes generator power, see deep dive) |
| BATTERY   | Panel is islanded, running on battery                             |
| PV        | Panel is islanded, running on solar (future)                      |
| GENERATOR | Panel is islanded, running on generator (future)                  |
| NONE      | Panel is islanded with no power source                            |
| UNKNOWN   | State not yet determined or fault condition                       |

When a BESS is installed, the panel relies on the BESS to determine whether the grid is online and to set the GFE accordingly. If BESS communication is lost
while the panel is islanded, the GFE value becomes stale — it may show Battery when the grid has actually been restored, causing unnecessary shedding to
continue.

**On a panel with no battery, GFE is Grid, on both firmware generations.** The newer firmware moves this value onto the Microgrid Interconnect Device, which is
part of a battery system — so a panel without one has nothing publishing it. The answer is still settled, by what cannot be there: Battery needs a BESS (which
brings a MID), PV cannot form a grid on its own (anything that can is a grid-forming inverter, which is a MID), and None describes a panel supplying nothing,
which is a panel that is not reporting at all. What remains is a generator, and SPAN with no generator interface treats one as the grid. So Grid is what a
battery-less panel reports, which is what the older firmware reported too.

#### What the Panel Can Detect

**Grid loss** — The panel independently detects grid loss via its own voltage monitoring, even if BESS communication is already lost. The MID is still closed at
this point, so the panel's sensors see the real voltage drop and respond immediately.

**Grid restoration while islanded** — Not detectable by the panel. While the MID is open, the panel's sensors are on the home side and measure only
battery-supplied power. Grid restoration on the utility side of the open MID is invisible to any panel-side measurement. This is a physical limitation, not a
software gap. A utility-side sensor — such as a current clamp (e.g., Emporia Vue), ATS/MTS contact closure, or any device that can see the grid side of the MID
— integrated into Home Assistant as a binary sensor can provide this signal.

#### DSM State Sensor

The integration's `DSM State` sensor combines multiple panel signals to provide defense-in-depth for grid status detection. It corroborates the Grid Forming
Entity with BESS grid state and power measurements, which adds confidence during transient inconsistencies and detects some edge cases — for example, when BESS
communication is lost while on-grid and the grid subsequently drops, the panel self-corrects via voltage detection and the corroborating signals confirm it.

However, when the panel is islanded and the MID is open, all of the panel's signals measure the home side. No combination of panel-sourced data can detect grid
restoration in this state. Only an external signal (utility-side sensor) or manual confirmation via the GFE Override button can resolve it.

#### GFE Override Button

The **GFE Override: Grid Connected** button tells the panel that the grid is back and shedding can stop. When the BESS restores communication, it automatically
reclaims control and the override is superseded — no manual undo is needed.

The button is available only while the panel is not already on grid and the battery's **Communication State** is anything other than OK, which is when the panel
accepts the override. On firmware that does not publish that state, it is available unless **BESS Connected** is on.

**Risk asymmetry** — Telling the panel to shed (conservative direction) is low-risk; worst case is unnecessary circuit disruption. Telling the panel the grid is
back when it is not means unmanaged battery drain and reduced runtime, which could affect critical equipment. The battery protects itself by disconnecting when
depleted, so there is no overload risk, but runtime will be reduced. Use the override button only with confidence that the grid has actually been restored — via
a utility-side sensor or manual confirmation.

**WARNING** — Do _not_ automate the GFE override button based on `DSM State` — it inherits the same MID blind spot described above and will read `dsm_off_grid`
even after the grid is restored. Manual confirmation or an external sensor is required before pressing the button.

When `bess_connected` returns to on, no action is needed — firmware resumes normal GFE management automatically.

[BESS & Grid Management Deep Dive](bess-grid-management.md).

## Configuration Options

### Snapshot Update Interval

Controls how often the integration rebuilds the panel snapshot from incoming MQTT data. The SPAN panel publishes high-frequency MQTT messages (~100/second), but
each individual message is a cheap dictionary write. The expensive operation — rebuilding the full snapshot and dispatching entity updates — is rate-limited by
this timer.

- **Default:** 1 second
- **Range:** 0–15 seconds
- **Set to 0** for no debounce (every MQTT message triggers a snapshot rebuild)
- **Increase on low-power hardware** (e.g., Raspberry Pi) to reduce CPU usage

Configure via `Settings` > `Devices & Services` > `SPAN Panel` > `Configure` > `General Options`.

### Entity Naming Pattern

The integration provides flexible entity naming patterns, configured during initial setup:

1. **Friendly Names** (Recommended for new installations)

   - Entity IDs use descriptive circuit names from your SPAN panel
   - Example: `sensor.span_panel_kitchen_outlets_power`
   - Renaming a circuit in the SPAN app updates the displayed name automatically — the integration reloads itself to pick the new name up, since it travels as
     the entity's original name and only a rebuild refreshes it; the entity ID changes only if you accept the offer from **Recreate entity IDs**
   - More intuitive for automations and scripts

2. **Circuit Numbers** (Stable entity IDs)

   - Entity IDs use generic circuit numbers
   - Example: `sensor.span_panel_circuit_15_power`
   - Entity IDs stay stable when circuits are renamed
   - Friendly names still sync from SPAN panel for display

The integration supplies only the circuit half of the ID shown above — `Kitchen Outlets Power` or `Circuit 15 Power`. Home Assistant composes the rest from your
own entity ID settings (`entity_id_parts`, Home Assistant 2026.8 and newer), which decide whether the device name and the area are prefixed.

For an entity that already exists, the suffix wording in that half is read back from the ID the entity has rather than reworded. Circuit energy IDs have shipped
in two spellings — `consumed_energy` and `energy_consumed` — so an installation is offered whichever one it is already using, and never the other; only new
sensors get the `consumed_energy` word order that the panel-level sensors use. Because your entity ID settings decide the rest of the ID, an installation whose
circuits were named before those settings existed — a SPAN Drive feed circuit, a second panel, or an installation predating the device prefix — may be offered
an ID with a different device half. Entities you already have keep the IDs they have until you press **Recreate entity IDs** and accept the offer.

### Energy Dip Compensation

SPAN panels occasionally report lower energy readings for cumulative energy sensors after firmware updates or resets. Home Assistant's statistics engine
interprets any decrease as a counter reset, creating negative spikes in the energy dashboard.

When enabled, the integration automatically detects these dips and maintains a cumulative offset per sensor so Home Assistant always sees a monotonically
increasing value.

- **Default for new installs:** ON
- **Default for existing installs:** OFF (enable via General Options)
- **Threshold:** 1.0 Wh minimum to avoid false triggers from float precision noise
- **Disabling:** Clears all accumulated offsets (starts fresh if re-enabled)

A dip is compensated as soon as it is seen, but not believed straight away. A counter reset is permanent — the counter restarts low and counts up from there —
so a reading that drops and then returns to where it was is a transport artifact rather than a reset, and its offset is taken back. The offset stays provisional
until a later reading either disproves it (the counter comes back) or corroborates it (the counter climbs from the new, lower base).

**The persistent notification therefore lists a dip once it settles — when that window closes — and a dip that is disproved produces no notification at all** —
the sensor was compensated the whole time and nothing needs your attention. Reporting on corroboration alone left a notice standing for an event the next
reading undid, which a persistent notification cannot take back the way the offset can. Seeing no notification after a momentary dip is the feature working, not
failing.

**Diagnostic attributes** (visible when compensation is active):

| Attribute        | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `energy_offset`  | Cumulative Wh compensation applied (when > 0) |
| `last_dip_delta` | Size of the most recent dip in Wh             |

**Before upgrading to 2.1.2,** check the `energy_offset` of your Produced and Consumed Energy sensors as described under **Energy Dashboard spikes after
firmware updates** in [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). At the first update after the upgrade, Main Meter Net Energy steps once by its counters' offsets,
which it now applies, and a solar circuit's Net Energy steps by twice the difference of its counters' offsets, which it now applies in its own direction. A load
circuit's Net Energy does not step. An offset far larger than its sensor's reading was never a real reset: turn Energy Dip Compensation off and then back on to
clear it before you upgrade.

Configure via `Settings` > `Devices & Services` > `SPAN Panel` > `Configure` > `General Options`.

### Customizing Entity Precision

The power sensors report with the exact precision from the SPAN panel, which may be more decimal places than you need. By default, sensors display with
precision 2 (e.g., `0.00`), except battery percentage which uses precision 0 (e.g., `39`).

You can change the display precision for any entity via `Settings` > `Devices & Services` > `Entities` tab. Find the entity, click on it, click the gear wheel,
and select your preferred precision from the "Display Precision" menu.

## Security

**The integration cannot enforce much on its own.** Anything holding the eBus broker password — including another integration in the same Home Assistant process
— talks to the panel directly, outside Home Assistant's permission model.

**What pinning the panel's certificate authority implies**:

- A **listener** cannot read your passphrase or the credentials the panel returns for it.
- A device **actively in the path at that first fetch** can answer with an authority of its own and read both. Pinning alone cannot detect this (see deployment
  recommendations).

Comparing the fingerprint against another source closes the second case. It is in diagnostics under `panel_ca`, and in the log of the setup that pinned it — at
`INFO` from the config flow, at `WARNING` for an entry pinned on upgrade. After the first pin, any change stops the integration and raises a repair — see
Troubleshooting.

### Restricting who can operate the panel

Four options in **Settings → Devices & Services → Span Panel → Configure**. Each is enforced where commands are published rather than only at the entity, so a
refusal holds however the command arrived.

| Option                                     | Default                                                                                                                  | What it refuses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | What it does not do                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who may operate the panel**              | Any Home Assistant user — Home Assistant's own policy, which grants every non-admin control of every entity              | `Administrators only` refuses circuit switches, priority selects, the GFE override, EVSE limits and adopted controls from non-admin users. `Nobody` also stops those entities being created.                                                    | Neither touches sensors. Neither reaches an automation, which runs with no user at all — pair it with the next option.     |
| **Allow control without a logged-in user** | Off for a new install. An install set up before this default changed keeps its setting: on, unless you had turned it off | While off, refuses every command with no user attached: all automations, and any script or integration an automation calls. A script a person runs keeps that person's user and is unaffected. Turn it on if your automations operate circuits. | It cannot tell a well-behaved automation from a runaway one — only that neither has a user.                                |
| **Control lock auto-relock**               | Off, and no switch exists                                                                                                | A switch that, while armed, refuses every control command. Anyone can arm it; only a logged-in administrator can disarm it. `0` holds the disarm until someone re-arms; any other value re-arms after that many minutes.                        | It is not a password. It defends against misclicks and runaway automations, which is what a local control can actually do. |
| **Relay debounce**                         | 2 seconds — **the one default that is not what your panel did before this release**; set `0` to restore that             | A second command to the same circuit's relay inside the window. Refused, never queued.                                                                                                                                                          | It is per circuit, so an automation cycling many circuits still gets through.                                              |

**What none of this defends against.** These options constrain callers arriving through Home Assistant, and nothing else. Anything already holding the broker
credential — a second Home Assistant instance, a script you wrote, a malicious custom integration reading it out of this process's memory — publishes to the
panel directly; see [Recommended deployment](#recommended-deployment), where network topology and a locked enclosure are the real boundary.

**Choosing `Nobody` deletes nothing.** The control entities stop being created and read as unavailable, but their registry entries, names, areas and
customizations are kept, so turning the option back on restores exactly the entities you had. For an administrator, the shipped SPAN Panel card and dashboard
offer no breaker switch or priority while `Nobody` is chosen. A non-administrator's card finds its entities without the panel's topology, so it shows those
switches dimmed and inert, as other dashboards show them unavailable.

### The record of what was commanded

Every control command fires a `span_panel_control_command` event and appears in the logbook, whether it succeeded, was refused, or never reached the panel. When
there is no user — an automation — the originating automation or script is named instead, so an unattended write is attributed to _what_ rather than left blank.
Every command is also logged at `INFO`.

Commands report one of four outcomes, or a refusal, and the distinctions matter:

| Outcome       | Meaning                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `confirmed`   | The panel reported the value you asked for.                                              |
| `accepted`    | The broker acknowledged the message and the panel did not report a change.               |
| `unconfirmed` | Nothing came back within the deadline. **Not an error** — see the troubleshooting entry. |
| `failed`      | The command was never handed to the broker and will not be delivered.                    |
| `refused:…`   | This integration refused it, for the named reason.                                       |

### Rotating panel credentials

This asks the panel to replace its passphrase, which is currently also the password for the connection the integration uses, stores the new broker password, and
reloads. Access tokens the panel has already issued, including the integration's, are not revoked. Run it after a contractor visit, a suspected exposure, or
anything else that put someone in front of your panel.

```yaml
action: span_panel.rotate_credentials
data: {}
```

**Run it yourself, from the interface, and save the new passphrase.** Only a Home Assistant administrator can, and an automation or script cannot. The new panel
passphrase is shown in the action's response and nowhere else: the integration does not store it. With more than one panel, set the **Config entry** field to
say which — the action refuses to guess.

**Anything else talking to your panel stops until you set it up again.** A second Home Assistant, a script, third-party tooling: each has to be given the new
password before it reconnects. This integration handles itself: the broker may not accept the new password as soon as the panel returns it, so the integration
keeps retrying with the new password for about a minute.

**A refused rotation changes nothing, so fix the cause and run it again.** If the panel rejects the integration's sign-in, or says its access token has reduced
privileges, reauthenticate it with the panel passphrase first. If a repair about the panel's certificate is open, resolve that first — a new password is never
sent over a connection that cannot be verified.

**If the panel does not report the outcome, assume the passphrase may have changed.** Run the action again: its response gives you a passphrase you know. It
works whether or not the integration is loaded, because the panel does not revoke the integration's access token. If the panel refuses that rotation,
reauthenticate the integration, using proof of proximity if the old passphrase is no longer accepted.

**If the response says `reconnected: false`, save the passphrase, then rotate again.** The integration has stored the new password, but the broker was still
refusing it after about a minute. Run the action again, even though the integration is not loaded: the integration uses the newly returned password, and the
passphrase in that response is the one to keep. As a last resort, restart the panel.

### Recommended deployment

The panel credential is a single all-or-nothing secret, and anyone standing at the panel can mint a fresh one with three presses of the door switch. Network
topology and physical control of the panel are the real boundary; everything above is defense in depth behind it.

- **Put the panel on a trusted VLAN**, with default-deny between VLANs, and allow only the Home Assistant host to reach it. Open `tcp/443` (REST), `tcp/8883`
  (MQTTS) and `tcp/80` (the plaintext certificate-authority fetch, and REST too until the entry pins), and deny `tcp/9001` and `tcp/9002` unless you are
  actively using the SPAN Home on-premise UI.
- **Use the IP address or an FQDN, and the `.local` name only** if you have an mDNS repeater like Avahi. The panel's IP is already in its certificate SAN, and
  for an FQDN the integration registers it so the panel adds it.
- **Secure the panel enclosure**, because the three-press proximity bypass hands full credentials to anyone who can open the door — the equivalent of a printed
  root password. This outranks every software control on this page.
- **Put dashboard-only household members in Home Assistant's read-only group.** Home Assistant's default user policy grants every non-admin user control of
  every entity, which includes this integration's circuit switches and priority selects.
- **Encrypt your Home Assistant backups.** An unencrypted backup contains `.storage/core.config_entries`, and the panel credentials in it are in plaintext.
- **Enable multi-factor authentication on Home Assistant** and do not expose its API directly to the Internet. A compromised Home Assistant administrator
  account is a compromised panel. Consider the use of Tailscale, a free and secure mesh network service, if you need to reach Home Assistant from your own
  devices over the Internet.
- **A proxy may forward traffic, but must not answer for the panel.** One that passes the traffic through untouched as raw TCP works normally, as long as Home
  Assistant still reaches the panel by a name the certificate covers: its IP address, its `.local` name, or a domain set through **Reconfigure**. Point that
  name at the proxy in DNS rather than entering the proxy's own address, which is refused.

## WebSocket API

The integration provides a `span_panel/panel_topology` WebSocket command that returns the full physical layout of a panel in a single call — circuits with their
breaker slot positions, entity IDs grouped by role, and sub-devices (BESS, MID, EVSE, PV) with their entities, and for each solar device the inverter it
describes and the circuit reading that is its power.

See [WebSocket API Reference](websocket-api.md) for the full schema, response format, and usage examples.

Caused by the panel reporting decreased values on otherwise`TOTAL_INCREASING` sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Prevention:** enable [Energy Dip Compensation](#energy-dip-compensation) in General Options (on by default for new installs). **Fix existing spikes:** in **Developer Tools → Statistics**, search for the affected sensor (e.g. `sensor.span_panel_main_meter_consumed_energy`) and use **Adjust sum** to correct the errant entry. The integration also posts a persistent notification when a compensated dip on any energy sensor settles (see [Energy Dip Compensation](#energy-dip-compensation)). **If you enabled compensation before 2.1.0 and saw spikes at restart:** check `energy_offset` on your energy sensors in **Developer Tools → States** — an offset far larger than the sensor's own reading is compensation for a dip that never happened, and toggling Energy Dip Compensation off discards it. Offsets booked before 2.1.0 were never corroborated, so the integration cannot tell a good one from a bad one retrospectively; the spikes already in statistics still need **Adjust sum** either way. |

This integration's unique IDs do not change with the naming style, so the remembered ID wins over the one the new style asks for. Either clear the leftover registry entries between removing and reinstalling, or wait out the 30 days and let Home Assistant discard them. A tool such as [ha-registry-clean](https://github.com/LegoTypes/ha-registry-clean) can do the clearing; it is a separate project, not part of this integration.

| **The Adopted tab is missing from the dashboard**                            | The dashboard offers By Activity, By Area and Monitoring, but neither**Adopted** nor **By Panel**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The panel dropdown at the top of the dashboard is on**Favorites**, which merges every configured panel into one workspace rather than being a panel itself, so the tabs that only mean something for a single panel are not offered there. Switch the dropdown to a panel and both come back; the selection is remembered per browser. Adopted is also administrator-only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **A control reports `unconfirmed`**                                          | The logbook or the`span_panel_control_command` event says a command was `unconfirmed`. Nothing appears broken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **This is not an error.** It means the panel took the command and did not report a change within the deadline, and the most common reason by far is that there was no change to report — the relay was already open, the priority was already that value. It is also indistinguishable from a silent rejection by the panel, because SPAN's firmware sends no reason code; the integration reports what it observed rather than guessing. The two outcomes that do mean something went wrong are `failed`, which means the command was never sent, and `refused:…`, which means this integration refused it and names why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
