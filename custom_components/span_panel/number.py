"""Number entities for the Span Panel — today, one per commissioned EV charger.

The charge-current ceiling is the only settable property v1.0 puts outside the
panel and its circuits, and the only control this integration has ever offered
that carries a physical bound: the installer commissions a maximum from the
breaker rating and J1772 derating, and nothing a user does may exceed it.

So every number this platform builds is described by the panel rather than by
this module. The value, the maximum, and the fact that a control exists at all
come from the charger's own `$description`, resolved in the library
(`span_panel_api_schema_1.charge_limit`) because the node carrying the limit has
two spellings in circulation and the `$description` is the specification's
authority on which one a charger publishes. Nothing here names a wire property.

**A control is offered only where the panel declares one.** `$settable` on the
limit is what creates the entity; the commissioned ceiling is what bounds it.
A charger that declares neither gets no entity, which is the honest rendering of
`charge-limit.md`'s absence semantics — "the EVSE has no adjustable
charge-current ceiling (it charges at a fixed rate)".

**A pending write shows as an attribute, not as a state.** The panel echoes an
accepted command on the Homie `$target` topic and republishes the property when
it takes effect, and the priority select already renders that pair exactly this
way (`circuit.priority_target`). Reporting the requested value as the state
instead would show a limit the charger may never have accepted.
