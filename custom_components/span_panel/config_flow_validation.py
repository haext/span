    """Decide how this entry's REST calls should reach the panel.

    `verify_hostname=False` keeps the pin and drops only the name binding, for
    the single case that needs it: a reconfigure of a pinned entry whose panel
    is answering at an address its certificate does not yet name. Such a panel
    has proven it holds a key the pinned anchor signed -- nothing else can
    complete the handshake -- but every call to it still fails hostname
    verification, so without this the flow cannot probe the panel, cannot ask
    it to regenerate its certificate, and cannot repair the situation it
    exists to repair.

    It is for a flow deciding *which* host to talk to, and for nothing else. It
    must never reach a transport that gets stored on the entry or used at
    runtime: the name binding is what stops a validated certificate being
    replayed by a host it was not issued to, and a coordinator carrying data
    over a relaxed context would give that up permanently rather than for the
    length of one flow.

    A malformed stored PEM falls back to plaintext rather than raising. The
    alternative is a config entry that cannot make a single REST call until
    somebody edits `.storage` by hand, which is a worse outcome than the
    transport this entry had before it was pinned — and the CA-changed repair is
    the path back to a good pin.

    That trade is right for a caller whose alternative is not working at all. It
    is wrong for one carrying a secret: a credential rotation sends the access
    token out and a fresh broker password back, and doing that unverified undoes
    the pin at the one moment it matters most. Such a caller passes
    `allow_plaintext_fallback=False` and gets `PanelCaUnusableError` instead of a
    quiet downgrade. An entry with no stored PEM at all is not pinned in the first
    place and still gets the plaintext transport either way — the flag refuses a
    downgrade, it does not invent a pin.

    Raises:
        PanelCaUnusableError: `allow_plaintext_fallback` is False and the stored
            PEM is not a certificate this system accepts.
