A fallback and nothing more: the panel publishes this port during registration
and every v2 entry carries it, so a stored value is what is actually used. It is

unusable, rather than refuse an otherwise healthy entry over it."""

PANEL_CA_PENDING = "panel_ca_pending"
"""Set in `entry.data` for a v2 entry that predates CA pinning.

The CA cannot be fetched in `async_migrate_entry` — that runs during startup, so
a network call there delays boot whenever the panel is unreachable and leaves a
failed fetch with no recovery path. The flag defers it to the first successful
setup, which retries on every subsequent one for free. Same shape as
`solar_migration_pending`.

**Only the migration sets this.** A newly configured entry always carries a pin,
because the config flow fetches and confirms the CA before it authenticates and
refuses to continue without one — registration is the exchange that carries the
passphrase.

An upgraded entry is a different case, but not a risk-free one, and the
difference is not that nothing is at stake. Its MQTTS session authenticates with
the broker password, and with no `ca_pem` the library falls back to fetching the
CA over unauthenticated plaintext HTTP on every connect and trusting whatever
answers — which is the substitution this pin exists to close. So an unpinned
upgraded entry is exposed on each connect until the flag settles.

Starting anyway is still right, for a different reason: that exposure is exactly
the status quo ante. It is what the entry already had under 3.0.1, and refusing
to start does not remove it — it removes the integration, and an integration
that will not start protects nothing. Retrying converts a pre-existing, bounded
exposure into a closed one at the first successful setup; refusing converts it
into a guaranteed outage with the credential no safer."""
