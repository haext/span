"""Snapshot field paths this integration reads.

Most declarations live on the entity descriptions that read them, so they
cannot drift from the reader. A few readers are in entity code rather than on a
description; those are listed here.

This module replaced `schema_expectations.SENSOR_FIELD_MAP` (since deleted), a
hand-maintained parallel dict that had already drifted once (it pointed at
`battery.product_name` and `pv.product_name` after the library renamed those
fields to `battery.model` / `pv.model`).

    description against the recorder and asserts the reason it claims, so a

    Reading exactly one producible field is **always** a declaration, however
    much arithmetic, mapping or membership-testing is applied on top. "Computed
    from `status`" is not derivation: `field_path="evse.status"` with a
    `value_fn` of `status in {...}` declares its source correctly and still
    computes whatever it likes. `evse_ev_connected` was misclassified as derived
    this way, which cost it both a Repair mention and its unavailability, while

"""Residual readers exempt from the producible check, and why each is exempt.

The gate requires a path to be producible by *both* adapters, so a read is
exempt for one of two reasons, and the annotation says which:
`Producibility.NEITHER` for values no adapter publishes a metadata row for —
Homie `$target` echoes, values the library assembles from panel topology, every
`mid.*` field; `SCHEMA_0_ONLY` / `SCHEMA_1_ONLY` for schema-conditional fields
present on one schema and absent from the other.

Exempt is not the same as derived: these are read straight off a snapshot field,
that field just is not on both schemas.

The annotations are not documentation. `tests/test_field_path_conformance.py`
builds both adapters' metadata from their reference payloads and asserts every
entry's annotation against what those adapters actually produce, so a stale
reason fails the build instead of misleading a reader. A path that becomes
producible by both fails there too, demanding promotion to a declaration.

    A handful of reads cannot be expressed as a description `field_path`: the
    switch has no entity description at all, the select wraps one rather than
    being a frozen dataclass, and a circuit entity's name, tabs and attributes
    are read outside any `value_fn`. Each such read is declared on the entity
    that makes it -- `SpanPanelEntity._residual_field_paths` -- because the
    entity is what a Repair has to name when the field dies.

    Collected from those declarations rather than restated as a constant here:
    a second copy would need a test to hold it against the first, and the copy
    that the Repair actually consumes is the entity's.

    The walk sees only classes Python has imported, so the platform modules
    that declare residuals are imported here explicitly -- exactly those, no
    more: a module listed here that declares nothing is a stale import, and one
    that declares something and is missing would go missing silently. Both
    directions are pinned by
    `test_the_residual_walk_imports_exactly_the_modules_that_declare_one`, which
    reads this list out of the source because under pytest the platform modules
    are already imported for other reasons and an omission here would still walk.
