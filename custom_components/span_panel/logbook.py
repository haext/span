"""Render control commands in the logbook.

Discovered by name: Home Assistant looks for `logbook.async_describe_events` in
the integration and calls it once at startup. No manifest change is needed.

The audit event carries a wire address and a `user_id`; the logbook wants a
sentence. The translation is deliberately blunt about the four outcomes, because
the whole point of `PublishState` having four members rather than two is that
"the panel did it", "the broker took it and the panel did not act", "nothing came
back" and "this will never be delivered" send an investigation in four different
directions.

When there is no user, the originating automation or script is resolved from the
context so a contextless write is attributed to *what* rather than left blank —
which is the case the audit exists for.
