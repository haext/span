"""WebSocket commands for curating adopted entities.

Separate from `websocket.py` because the two answer different questions about
the same panel. That module reports the *curated* topology -- circuits, tabs,
sub-devices, the entity ids a dashboard renders from -- and its readers are
dashboards. This one reports what the panel publishes that nobody has modelled
yet, and its reader is an editor: every row carries the choices the user may
assert, computed from the wire declaration through Core's own maps, so the card
never offers an option the curate command would refuse.

**Nothing here writes registry state, and that is a boundary rather than an
omission.** Enabling, naming, icons, areas and display units are registry acts
the user makes through Core's own websocket commands, which already ask for
admin and already carry the undo. This module owns exactly the metadata Core has
nowhere to put -- a state class, a device class and prominence for an entity
built from a vendor declaration -- and `curation.py` owns whether an assertion
is admissible.

This module must not import `websocket.py`: registration runs the other way, so
the dependency has one direction and no cycle can appear as further commands
join the ones here.

    for a vendor property on a device this integration does model. A second
    derivation here would let the editor disagree with the entities it edits --
    offering a state class for a row that is really a control, or a key the
    curate command cannot resolve.

    `adoptable` is what decides which extension rows exist at all, so the cap and
    the wait-for-the-card deferral apply here exactly as they do to the entities:
    a row it declines has no entity, no card to group under and no name to show.

    Adopted declarations are sorted by `path` for the same reason `_create`
    sorts them, and the sort does the same job here: `adopted_unique_id` is
    deliberately non-injective, so two wire addresses can flatten onto one id,
    and the lexically first path claims it. **The other is skipped rather than
    listed**, mirroring `_create`, because a listed loser is not merely a row
    with no entity: `entity_id` resolves by (platform, unique_id), so it would
    report the *winner's* entity beside its own curation key -- inviting a record
    saved against an entity that will never read it, under a live entity_id
    saying it will. The skip is silent; `_create` already warns, naming both
    addresses, and a second line per list request would say nothing new.

    Claimed per platform, which is the scope the registry keys on: an entity is
    unique by (domain, integration, unique_id), so the same id under `sensor` and
    under `switch` is two entities and not a collision. `_create` runs once per
    platform and gets that scoping for free; one pass over every platform has to
    say so.

    Extension rows are sorted for a weaker version of the ordering reason:
    `adoptable` returns the already-registered rows first, so an unsorted list
    would reshuffle the card the moment a new row's entity appeared. They need no
    claim -- `extension_unique_id` carries the wire path verbatim and is
