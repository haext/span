"""Identity for vendor extension properties on devices this integration models.

The other half of vendor extensibility from `adoption.py`. That module adopts a
whole *device* nobody modelled; this one carries a new *property* on a device
this integration already models -- a battery vendor hanging `battery-2/
cell-temperature` off the BESS -- which until now reached the user nowhere.

**An adopted extension is a terminal identity.** It is a vendor reading on the
correct existing device card, disabled and diagnostic, in plain wire vocabulary,
and it stays that until an external trigger changes it: the publisher stops
publishing the property, or better metadata arrives. Nothing here promotes,
re-homes or migrates one on its own schedule, and curation is never blocked by
one existing -- an entity's `unique_id` and `entity_id` are permanent, its
*identity* carries no expectation of permanence beyond that.

**Terminal is not unimprovable, and the owner of the device is not guessing.**
A user who curates a row asserts what this module refuses to infer, and their
record arrives as metadata `curation.py` composes into the description built
here -- which is how a curated reading carries a state class without this
module naming the thing an AST guard forbids it to spell. It changes what an
entity *says*, never what it *is*: the id, the card and the platform are
untouched, and an uncurated row is exactly the entity it was before curation
existed.

**Nothing is ever removed by this integration.** A row the user deletes is
recreated -- disabled, as it arrives -- for as long as the property is still
published, so deletion is not suppression and no suppression feature is needed.
Deletion sticks exactly when publishing has stopped, because then nothing exists
to recreate it from. The delete button therefore already means "hide until next
setup" for a live reading and "clear this out" for a dead one, decided by the
wire rather than by a feature.

       a `%` state of charge, and `%` is deliberately absent from
