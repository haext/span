"""Compare adapter field metadata against what this integration declares it reads.

Consumes the library's three-way signal:

- entry, ``resolved=True`` — produced; the unit is meaningful
- entry, ``resolved=False`` — a device is present but does not declare the
  property. Degradation.
- **no entry** — no device of that type. Hardware absent; not a defect.

Because the adapter classifies absence, this module needs no capability table
and never infers hardware presence from telemetry.

**Two inventories, not one.** An adapter's metadata map carries curated rows —
snapshot field paths this integration knows about — and, under the library's
discovery namespace, rows for properties the panel declares and the adapter
reads nothing from. They answer opposite questions and must never mix:
`unread` below is "we produce this and render nothing from it", which is an
inventory of *our* backlog, while a discovered row is "the panel has something
we never modelled". Letting the second into the first would bury ten known
entries under whatever a firmware release happened to add, and would make the
conformance gate's producible set depend on the panel in front of the user.

So the metadata is partitioned by namespace before any other question is asked
of it — see `partition`.

mismatch its owner cannot act on and that reflects no real defect.
