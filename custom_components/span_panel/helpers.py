    **Nominal, not measured, and there is nothing better to read.** The eBus

    only; voltage is a panel-level quantity, published as the enclosure's
    ``meter/voltage-a`` / ``voltage-b``. No per-circuit voltage exists on the
    wire.

    **It is derived from the pole count, not from the positions.** Those are
    different claims and only the second would be unsound: the specification
    defines ``spaces`` as identifying every occupied slot "without assuming a
    numbering convention", so reading a leg out of a position *number* is
    exactly what the property exists to make unnecessary. The count comes from
    ``breaker/poles``, published outright. Given the count, SPAN supplies the
    rest -- it has stated that its panels "are split-phase and publish only 1-
    or 2-pole breakers" -- and on a split-phase service a two-pole breaker is
    line-to-line across both legs. So 240 rests on a vendor statement about
    service type, not on a layout convention.

    **Which is also why it stops at two poles.** Three or more is not a
    split-phase circuit at all -- 208V line-to-line on a three-phase wye
    service, 240V on a high-leg delta -- and nothing published distinguishes
    them. Deriving it from ``P / I`` does not rescue it either: that yields
    ``V * pf`` through a 0.1A quantiser, which on real circuits lands within 1%
    once in 27 and reads 0V for any circuit drawing standby current at zero
    real power. None means we do not know, and callers omit the attribute

    flag the way `bess` or `pcs` are. It reaches the reload trigger as its
    identities, digested — see `identity_digest` for why the raw ids must not appear here.

    **One token each rather than one hash of the set.** The trigger fires on set
    *expansion* (`current - known`), and a hash of a shrinking set is as "new" as
    a hash of a growing one — so a single token would reload the integration when
    a vendor device left the tree, and flap it on a device that came and went.
    Per-identity tokens make the expansion-only rule hold for free: a device that
    arrives adds a token, a device that leaves removes one, and only the first is
    a reload.

    The extension token digests its **instance key** and keeps its subject kind
    and wire path in the clear. The key is an identity — an EVSE's node id, a
    circuit's uuid — and can carry the same serial a device id can; `battery` and
    `meter/cell-temperature` are vendor vocabulary that names no install.

    Keyed on the wire identity rather than on the value: a reading changing is
    every refresh, and the question here is only whether an entity that could not
    be created at setup now can.
