"""The types that describe a Span Panel config entry's runtime data.

A leaf module on purpose. `SpanPanelConfigEntry` is the annotation every
platform, the coordinator, the migrations and the services need, and it used to
live in the package root -- which imports every platform. Naming the entry type
therefore meant importing the whole integration, so the modules that needed only
the annotation reached for it from inside functions instead, and `services.py`
grew five copies of the same runtime-data guard around five deferred imports.

Nothing here imports anything from this package at runtime except
`control_gate` and `curation`, and neither reaches back into the platforms:
`control_gate` sees `const` and `options`, `curation` sees `const` and `util`.
`SpanPanelCoordinator` is needed only as an annotation, so it is imported under
`TYPE_CHECKING`: a module that wants to say "this is a SPAN entry" should not
have to pull in the coordinator and, through it, the schema and sensor
machinery.

    `async_unload_entry` after the platforms have gone, and

    up -- hence `getattr` with a default rather than an attribute read. And what
    is there is whatever the owning integration put there, so `isinstance` is
    what says it is ours; a test double may put anything at all in it.

    One helper, one answer. It lives here rather than in `services` because
    `services` is not a leaf and half the callers are not services: this module
    already owns the type the check is against, and importing it costs nothing.
