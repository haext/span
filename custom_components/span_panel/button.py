        The override is only relevant when BESS communication is lost and the
        panel is not already reporting grid-connected. When BESS is online or the
        panel already reads on-grid, firmware is managing correctly and the button
        should not be pressable.

        The second check reads `dsm_state`, not the grid-forming entity. It asks
        "are we already on the grid", which is what `dsm_state` answers directly and
        the GFE answers only by implication -- and, unlike the GFE, it is populated on
        both wire schemas, so this stays free of any knowledge of which one is
        underneath. It used to compare `dominant_power_source` to `"GRID"`, which is
        `None` under v1.0 and so never fired there at all.

        One useful consequence: `dsm_state` folds in the user's own assertion, so once
        a press takes effect the button disables itself rather than inviting a second.

        **The battery's own link health decides, when it is published.** The panel
        accepts the assertion only while the battery's communication state is not
        `OK`, so any other value (`LOST`, `DEGRADED`, `UNKNOWN`) makes the button
        available. When no communication state is published, `connected` decides
        instead, and an absent connection status counts as eligible because the
        panel still accepts the assertion then.
