"""Notifications that outlive a restart.

A persistent notification lives in memory. Raise one, restart Home Assistant,
and it is gone whether or not anybody read it. That is why the things worth
saying exactly once have historically been filed as Repairs instead: a Repair is
stored, so it stands until the user dismisses it.

That trade is a bad one. The Repairs list means "something wants your attention
because it went wrong" -- it is stamped with a severity, it offers to fix or
ignore, and everything else filed there is a defect. Putting good news in it
tells the user their panel is broken. A firmware upgrade that took nothing away
arrived looking like a warning, which is the opposite of what it was for.

This module keeps the notification and buys back the one property the Repair had
that it lacked. A notice raised here is recorded per config entry and re-raised
at every setup until it is dismissed, and the dismissal is *observed* rather than
assumed: Home Assistant reports removals to a registered callback, so "the user
has seen it" is a fact rather than a hope. A notice therefore survives a restart,
a reload, and an owner who was on holiday when their panel upgraded.

Which is durable and which is not is a real distinction, not a default. A notice
belongs here when it reports something that happened once and cannot be
re-derived -- a firmware upgrade, an entity that appeared. Anything re-derived
from live state on every refresh does not belong here; it belongs in
`schema_repairs`, which reconciles instead, and where being a defect is the
point.

There is a middle case, and `async_raise_on_change` is for it: a condition that
*is* re-derived at every setup, but whose news value is spent the first time it
is reported. Raised through `async_raise` such a notice reappears after every
dismissal, which makes it un-dismissable in practice. That function remembers
what was announced, so the notice returns only when what it says changes.
