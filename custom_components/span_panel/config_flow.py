        rewritten to point at it. Both routes into this reach it before anything
        has been authenticated — an `_ebus._tcp` record is whatever the LAN
        chose to broadcast, and the serial that matched came from the candidate
        host's own unauthenticated `/api/v2/status` — so on its own, "claims to
        be this serial" is a claim anything on the network can make.

        A pinned entry has a better question available: does the candidate serve
        a certificate this entry's own anchor validates? Nothing but the panel
        holding the matching key can answer it, and it is precisely the check
        the entry's own connections will apply afterwards. Moving a pinned entry
        onto a host that fails it is not a recoverable mistake either way round:
        an impostor gets the entry pointed at itself and the user a CA-changed
        repair inviting them to accept its fingerprint, while an honest name the
        panel simply does not serve — a single-label host, an FQDN never
        registered — leaves the entry unable to reach its own panel with no flow
        left to correct it.

        Verified as the host would be *stored*, against the port the entry
        already uses. The address fallback that `_async_choose_bootstrap_host`
        applies is deliberately not repeated: that one exists to dial a panel
        while a name is unverified, and accepting a name here because its
        address validates would persist exactly the host that fallback refuses
        to write.

        An entry with no anchor keeps the behaviour it shipped with. There is no
        pin to protect and no check to make, so refusing the move would cost an
        unpinned install its panel and buy nothing.

        An add-on restart republishes the container hostname it answers on,

        entry seconds after creation: the panel's certificate names the address
        the user typed and does not name the add-on's hostname, so every
        connection afterwards failed verification against the entry's own pin.

        The question that decides it is the same one the entry itself asks on

        Unlike zeroconf, several panels may be reachable on the same host IP

        Deduplicate by panel serial, not by host, so each panel gets its own
        config entry.

        **The ports are deliberately not held to the pinned-address check** that
        `async_step_zeroconf` and the by-hand re-add both go through, in
        `_async_host_update`. A Supervisor discovery arrives over the
        authenticated Supervisor API from an add-on the user installed, and
        add-ons legitimately reallocate their own ports across restarts, so
        holding the ports to the stored values would freeze the entry against
        its own add-on. They go straight into the update below.

        The *host* is a different question and is not carried by that argument.
        An add-on reallocating a port has not moved, and the address the user
        configured is the one their panel's certificate names; overwriting it
        with the add-on's own container hostname broke a working entry seconds
        after it was created, because that hostname is not a name the panel
        serves. So the host moves only when the configured one has stopped
        answering for this panel -- see `_async_hassio_host_update`. See
