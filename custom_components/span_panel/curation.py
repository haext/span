"""User-supplied metadata for adopted entities.

Adopted entities arrive with deliberately minimal metadata because the
integration refuses to guess. A user who owns the vendor device is not
guessing: this module stores their assertions -- `state_class`,
`device_class`, and prominence -- keyed by a scope-prefixed wire address,
validates them against what the wire actually declares, and hands the
platforms fully-formed entity descriptions at construction.

**This is the one module allowed to spell `state_class`.** `adoption.py` and
`extension.py` carry AST guards asserting the token never appears there; the
description helpers below are how a curated record becomes an entity
description without either module naming the thing it must not set.
