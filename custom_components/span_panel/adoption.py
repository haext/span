"""Entities for devices the panel publishes and this integration models nothing for.

The panel is a hub for whatever plugs into it, and the eBus schema is explicitly
vendor-extensible. A device type this integration has never modelled therefore
arrives as an expected event rather than a hypothetical one -- and until now it
arrived as nothing at all: no device, no entity, no sign it was there.

**This module's unit is a device. A property on a device already modelled is
`extension.py`'s**, and the split is where the two costs differ. On a device type
nobody has modelled, no better identity is coming, so a disabled diagnostic
entity is strictly better than the silence -- and a settable property becomes a
real control, because there is no curated control beside it for a generic write
path to undercut. On a curated device, curation is plausibly coming and its
controls do real work, so `extension.py` mints a terminal identity in plain wire
vocabulary and surfaces even a settable property as a reading.

**This module never decides that something enters long-term statistics.** It
spells no `state_class` anywhere -- an AST guard in `tests/test_adoption.py`
asserts the token is absent from the syntax, not merely from the paths a test
happens to construct. Three reasons, and the third is the one that shapes the
module: `state_class` is not declared on the wire and is not derivable from one
(`feedthroughEnergyProducedWh` is `TOTAL` beside `mainMeterEnergyProducedWh` as
`TOTAL_INCREASING` -- same unit, same device class); a wrong one writes corrupt
statistics that fixing the producer does not repair; and enrolling a property
nobody asked for into long-term statistics is a permanent write to every
install's recorder database.

**The owner of the device may still assert one, and that is a different act.**
A user curating a row is not guessing about their own hardware, and their
assertion arrives here as a `CurationRecord` that `curation.sensor_description`
turns into a description -- which is how a curated row gets a state class
without this module naming the thing it must not infer. Nothing is asserted by
default: an uncurated row is exactly the entity it was before curation existed.

**These entities declare no field paths.** `snapshot.adopted_devices` is outside
the curated field-path vocabulary by construction: it carries no metadata row, so
the producible gate has nothing to check it against and `residual_field_paths()`
must not collect it. That is why this module is absent from that walk's import
list, and why the classes below declare no `_residual_field_paths`.

    position, as `extract_circuit_uuid_from_unique_id` does, must not meet a
    second grammar. An earlier version lower-cased and de-hyphenated the whole
    string, which mangled the panel serial itself -- `span_sp3_242424_001_...`
    where every other id in the integration says `span_sp3-242424-001_...`.

    Only the node and property are de-hyphenated, because they are the segment

    the hyphens is what makes the suffix read like a curated one, and it is also

    adopted id an install already holds, which strands the entities keyed on them
    with nothing to migrate them back. So the collision is handled where the

    **One id is claimed by one property, and which one does not depend on the
    wire.** `adopted_unique_id` is not injective -- see its docstring for why that
    cannot be fixed by changing the encoding -- so two wire addresses can arrive
    at one id. Handing both to Home Assistant registers the first and drops the
    second *permanently*, with one core log line naming a `unique_id` the user
    cannot map back to anything on the wire. Skipping it here costs the same
    entity and names both addresses, so the case is reportable by whoever meets
    it.

    Claimed per platform, which is the scope the registry keys on: an entity is
    unique by (domain, integration, unique_id), so the same id under `sensor` and
    under `binary_sensor` is not a collision and must not be treated as one.

    **The winner is the lexically first wire path, not the first one published.**
    Adapter emission order tracks the wire, so a firmware update that declared
    the properties in the other order would have moved the id from one property
    to the other -- which is a *standing entity changing what it reads* with no
    id change to make it visible, and nothing here to migrate it back. Sorting on
    `path` makes the survivor a function of the declarations alone. Registry
    preference, which is how the extension cap resolves its equivalent problem,
    is not available: both properties resolve to the same `unique_id`, so the
    registry row cannot say which of them put it there.

    The sort covers a whole device rather than only the colliding pair, because a
    rule that only applied on collision would still depend on arrival order to
    decide which pair collided first.

    **The curated record is read through `for_row`, never off the overlay.** The
    store keeps whatever the user asserted when they asserted it, and the
    declaration it was asserted against can have moved since. `for_row` measures
    the record against the declaration in hand and drops what no longer fits;
    the raw record would reach `SensorDeviceClass(...)` unchecked and raise
