# Every SPAN sub-device hangs off the panel and says so with `via_device_id` --
# the panel's *registry* id, not its identifiers. Identifiers are unique only
# within a config entry, so linking by them is ambiguous by construction; Home
# Assistant deprecated `via_device` for that reason and stops honouring it in
# 2027.8. The id is resolved once during setup and carried on the entry's
# runtime data, because a sub-device is only ever built after the panel device
# exists -- which is what lets the builders below take a plain `str` and leaves
# no caller with an absence to handle.

# A sub-device's registry identifier is `{panel serial}_{kind}`, with EVSE
# carrying its node id after the kind because a panel can have several. PV takes
# both shapes: `{panel serial}_pv` for the panel's solar card, and
# `{panel serial}_pv_{inverter key}` for each inverter on a panel with more than
# one.
#
# Named here, beside the builders that construct them, because the topology
# WebSocket command has to read the grammar back. It used to restate it, and the
# MID shipped classifying as "unknown" for exactly that reason: a third kind was
# added to the writing end and not to the reading one. `classify_sub_device_identifier`
# is the reading end, so the two cannot drift again.

    The last DER to get a card of its own. Its vendor, model and nameplate
    capacity have been readable all along and were shown as three diagnostic
    sensors on the *panel's* card, beside the panel's own manufacturer and model,
    which reads as if the enclosure were an Enphase inverter. The firmware
    version the library also reads reached nothing at all, because a version has
    no home but a device card.

    **The identifier deliberately does not mention the inverter's serial.**
    `info/serial-number` is declared by every PV `$description` and published by
    no producer today, so an identifier preferring it would be `<panel>_pv` on
    every panel now and `<panel>_<serial>` on the first panel whose firmware
    starts publishing one -- and a device identifier is what a consumer keys its
    registry on, so that day would read as the inverter being replaced rather
    than as a value arriving. `{panel serial}_pv` answers the only question an
    identifier has to answer, "which panel's inverter", on a panel with one.
    The card describes what its PV entities read: the inverter they are bound
    to, or the inverters together; see `pv_binding`. The
    serial is not on the card either, for the same reason it is not in the
    identifier: nothing in this integration should start depending on it before
    a producer publishes one.

    **No area is seeded**, so an upgraded installation has to assign this card to
    an area the way it assigned the battery's and the chargers'. Both routes were
    considered and neither is clean. `DeviceInfo`'s `suggested_area` is deprecated
    with `breaks_in_ha_version="2026.9"`, one release past the version pinned
    here, so adopting it would be adopting a removal. An explicit
    `device_registry.async_update_device(area_id=...)` after setup cannot tell an
    area a user deliberately cleared from one never assigned -- the registry
    records `None` for both -- so it would silently re-assign the card on every
    reload. Doing nothing also keeps every sub-device the same: the BESS, the MID
    and each charger seed no area either.
