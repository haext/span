there. The flat adapter contains no reference to the field at all.

**Why this is asked of the adapter rather than of the field metadata**, which is
how every other "did the adapter produce this" question in this integration is
settled (`schema_validation`, `SpanPanelEntity._reads_an_unresolved_field`).
That machinery rests on the adapter classifying absence, and here it cannot: a
metadata row states a *reading's* unit and datatype, and the property behind
this field is topology rather than a reading, so schema_1 lists it in
`_CONSUMED_WITHOUT_A_ROW` and emits no row for it. Neither adapter publishes
`panel.lugs_at_service_entrance`, so the metadata map is silent for both the
panel that resolved the field and the panel that never looked -- exactly the
distinction that has to be drawn.

`SpanPanelSnapshot.lugs_at_service_entrance` is a plain `bool` defaulting to
True, alone among the snapshot's conditional members in having no `None` to mean
"not answered". Once span-panel-api makes it `bool | None` (wanted for 3.1.1),
