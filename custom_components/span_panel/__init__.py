    An entry provisioned since CA pinning landed already carries one. An entry
    that predates it carries `panel_ca_pending` instead, put there by the v7
    migration, and this is where that is settled — at setup, where the panel is
    about to be reachable anyway, rather than in the migration, which runs during
    startup and would delay boot for an unreachable panel.

    A failed fetch is not a setup failure. The flag survives, the next setup
    retries for free, and in the meantime the library falls back to its 3.0.1
    behaviour of refetching the CA on each connect. Refusing to start would trade
    a partial control for no integration at all.

    The store is logged at WARNING with the fingerprint on purpose. This is
    trust-on-first-use on an upgrade path — nobody confirmed this certificate
    against anything — and the user should be able to find the value afterwards
    to compare it against another install or the panel's own label.

    Trust on first use is not the same as trust in anything that answers. The
    fetch is plaintext and unauthenticated, so what comes back is checked
    against the certificate the panel's broker serves before it is stored; a CA
    that signs nothing the panel serves is not the panel's. A refusal is treated

    # `panel_rest_transport` builds on the HTTPS port for reauth detection,
    # reconfigure, FQDN registration and `rotate_credentials`. The broker's is
    # the connection this pin was introduced for, and the only one every v2
    # entry carries a port for: setup refuses an entry without
    # `CONF_EBUS_BROKER_PORT` a few lines above, and the same value is handed to
    # `MqttClientConfig` below.
    #
    # `https_port` was the wrong port to verify on for the entries that actually
    # reach here. It arrived in the same commit as `panel_ca_pending`, so an
    # entry carrying the flag is by definition one migrated from before either
    # existed and can never hold a port: every such check ran against 443, and a
    # pre-pinning install whose TLS lives elsewhere -- behind NAT, a port
    # forward, a proxy -- would have been refused on every setup and left on the
    # unauthenticated refetch path for good, which is the one population this
    # deferred pin exists for.

    # Verifying one port and using the anchor on two has a cost, and it is
    # stated rather than hidden: a CA that signs the broker's leaf but not
    # whatever answers on 443 -- a proxy terminating only the HTTPS port --
    # pins here and then fails every REST path. Since the runtime schema fetch
    # moved onto the pin (issue #264), that failure is no longer quiet: setup
    # retries under `ConfigEntryNotReady` with the `panel_rest_tls_untrusted`
    # Repair naming the port when something answers it badly, and with the
    # retry message naming the port and Reconfigure when nothing answers it at
    # all -- Reconfigure offers the HTTPS port to a pinned entry for exactly
    # this population. Never plaintext either way. README and the changelog
    # say so.

    The same question the library asks when the MQTT handshake fails under a
    pin, answered the same way, because the failure itself carries no evidence:
    re-read the CA the panel advertises — plaintext deliberately, since a fetch
    verified against the old pin would fail and tell us nothing — and compare
    fingerprints. The fetch is diagnostic only and never re-anchors anything.

    A different fingerprint is the CA-changed Repair, with its guided re-pin —
    a firmware reset rotating the CA is the common legitimate cause of this
    failure, and it already has a flow. It is also the only terminal outcome,
    which mirrors the library's own `_diagnose_verification_failure`: a
    matching fingerprint never escalates, because `SSLCertVerificationError`
    under an unchanged CA is three different conditions and two of them are
    transient. The leaf probe splits them. A leaf that names somewhere else is
    a moved panel — the leaf-mismatch Repair, which promises retrying, and
    setup keeps that promise. A leaf the pin does not validate at all is either
    something terminating TLS in front of the panel or a certificate a clock
    reset pushed outside its validity window — one Repair naming both, retried
    so the clock case heals itself and the proxy case stands visibly refused,
    never downgraded to plaintext. And missing evidence — the CA unreadable,
    the TLS port unreachable — retries with no verdict at all, because a panel
    mid-reboot must not be convicted of anything.
