"""Telling the user what this integration just added.

Split out of `schema_repairs` deliberately. An addition is not a repair: nothing
is broken, nothing needs fixing, and filing it in the Repairs list puts it in a
category whose whole meaning is "something wants your attention because it went
wrong". It is a notification, and it says what was added rather than only how
many.

Two things this fixes about the previous behaviour.

**Enabled additions were announced to nobody.** The old notice covered only
entities added `disabled_by=INTEGRATION`, on the reasoning that an enabled entity
is already visible in the entity list and its history. That reasoning does not
survive contact with how anyone actually uses Home Assistant: nobody watches
their entity count, so an addition that breaks nothing is indistinguishable from
no addition at all.

**The diff was derived from setup timing, so it was unrepeatable.** It compared
the registry before the platforms against the registry after, which answers
correctly exactly once: on the next startup the entity is already registered
beforehand and the diff is empty by construction. Anything not announced in that
one window was never announced. What is announced is now recorded, so the
question becomes "has this been announced" rather than "was this registered in
the last few seconds", and nothing is lost to a restart landing in the wrong
place.
