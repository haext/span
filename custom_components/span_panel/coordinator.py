        firmware upgrade invites the opposite assumption.

        `sensor.*_dsm_grid_state` keeps its entity id and its history and gets *more*
        trustworthy. Under flat, `schema_0` derived it: the battery's `grid-state` when
        one was commissioned, otherwise an inference from `dominant-power-source` and
        whether any power was crossing the grid connection. Under v1.0 it reads the
        islanding state the MID actually senses -- the heuristic v1.0 exists to retire,
        retired.

        `binary_sensor.*_grid_islandable` also survives. v1.0 publishes no panel-level
        `grid-islandable`, on purpose: `devices/bess.md` reads backup capability from
        the capability set, "a MID `grid` child means premises-segment backup", and
        "there is no single 'islanded?' bit to reconcile". So it now reflects MID
        presence, the classifier the spec nominates.

        What is genuinely new is the MID device itself and its `grid-state`, the health
        of the utility supply, which flat did not report at all.

        **One notice, not two.** This used to be a hardcoded English notification
        about the reload followed immediately by a translated Repair about the
        consequences -- two rows in two different places for one event, which is
        the same duplication that makes people stop reading either. They are now
        one message, and it is translated.

        **A notification, not a Repair.** The Repairs list is where defects go: it
        stamped this with a severity and offered to ignore it, so an upgrade that
        took nothing away arrived looking like a fault. The reason it was a Repair
        was durability -- a plain notification dies with the process, and somebody
        away when their panel upgraded would never have learned a device appeared.
        `notices` supplies that durability directly, so the classification no
        longer has to be paid for with a lie about severity.

        Scheduled as a task because reading the translations is blocking file I/O
        and the caller is the client's own synchronous callback fan-out. It races

        refuses every press -- an entity can see that about itself. A circuit
        that *becomes* commandable has no switch and no select at all, so there
        is nothing on it to notice; only a reader over every circuit can.

        A reload rather than a quiet availability change, because the entity
        should not exist -- or should exist and does not -- under the new
        answer, and creating and removing entities is what `async_setup_entry`
        is for. The baseline is updated on the same pass that asks for the
        reload, so a settled panel costs one dict comprehension per push and a
        changed one asks exactly once.

        Only circuits present in *both* readings are judged. A circuit can drop
        out of a snapshot and come back -- the platforms guard for exactly that
        -- and counting an absence as a settability change would turn a flap
        into a reload loop. Membership is still carried forward, so a circuit
        that leaves and returns with a different answer is caught on its return.

        One known false positive, upstream of here: a library client rebuilt
        mid-session replays retained MQTT topics, and a replay that arrives
        partial can present a circuit whose `relay-controllable` has not been
        redelivered yet. The absent field reads as True for that one dispatch,
        which looks like a settability change and costs one spurious reload per
        rebuild. It is a library item (3.1.1), not one this reader can settle --
        a partial snapshot is indistinguishable here from a real change -- and
