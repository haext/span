"""Fix flows for this integration's Repairs.

Discovered by name: Home Assistant looks for `repairs.async_create_fix_flow` in
the integration whenever an issue it raised is marked `is_fixable`.

One issue is fixable, and everything here exists for it. See `ca_repairs`.

    The fingerprint is taken from a *fresh* fetch rather than from the issue's
    stored one. The two should agree, and if they do not the panel has changed
    its CA twice — at which point the value the user is being asked to accept
    has to be the one that will actually be stored, not a record of an earlier
    observation. Accepting a fingerprint and pinning a different certificate
    would make the confirmation meaningless.

    That fresh fetch has to earn its place in the dialog: it is plaintext and
    unauthenticated, so it is checked against the certificate the panel serves
    before any fingerprint is shown. Everything this flow asks of the user rests
    on the value being the panel's own.
