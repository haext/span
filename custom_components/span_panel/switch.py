        what that probe is for. This one reports nothing from the panel. Arming

        of the three things it would have asked is answered here: the transport
        probe is the one this overrides; the unresolved-field probe never fires
        on an entity that declares no `field_path`, as this one does not; and
        `CoordinatorEntity`'s `last_update_success` is a fact about the last
        snapshot fetch, which this entity does not read and does not need.
