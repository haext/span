"""Who may operate this panel through Home Assistant, and a record of who did.

**What this is a boundary against.** Callers arriving through Home Assistant,
and nothing else. It does not constrain anything holding the broker credential:
a process with that credential publishes to the panel's broker directly and
never reaches this code, and that includes a malicious or buggy custom
integration running in the same Home Assistant process. Presenting this as a
security boundary around the *panel* would be the most damaging thing it could
do, because a user would stop looking for the real one — which is network
topology and a lock on the enclosure. The README says so too.

**Why it is split in two.** Authorization needs to know who is asking, and that
is knowable only at the entity: Home Assistant sets `Entity._context` from the
service call immediately before the handler runs. Completeness needs a single
choke point, and that exists only at the publish, inside the library. So
identity is captured at the entity into a `ContextVar` (see
`SpanPanelEntity._async_guarded_control`) and the decision is made in the
library's `ControlInterceptor`, which sees every control command including ones
a future code path forgets to route through the helper. Such a command arrives
with an empty `ContextVar` and is treated as contextless rather than silently
permitted — that is the fail-closed default, and it is the reason the gate lives
here rather than in the helper.
